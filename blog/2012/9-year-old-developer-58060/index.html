    How a 9-Year-Old Boy Became the Latest Internet Meme</a></div>
<div class="c2">via <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/" class=
    "f">ReadWriteWeb</a> by David Strom on 4/19/12</div>
<br class="c3">
<p class="c4"><a href=
  "http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/caine-mullick.jpg"><span><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/files/styles/150_150/public/files/start/assets_c/2012/04/caine-mullick-thumb-609x414-40488.jpg"
    alt="" width="150"></span></a> If you&#8217;re looking for a warm,
heart-rending story for today, look no further than how Caine
Monroy became the latest YouTube viral sensation, with more than
2.4 million views and counting since it was posted last week.</p>
<p class="c4">Thanks to a loyal customer, Nirvan Mullick (pictured
with Monroy), the schoolboy now has a $150,000 scholarship fund and
fans all over the world. And the story holds lessons for budding
online entrepreneurs, too. How did all this happen?</p>
<p class="c4">Last year, Monroy was just another nine-year-old kid
from East Los Angeles trying to figure out what to do with his
summer, when one day he went to his dad&#8217;s auto parts store. The
store was largely devoid of customers, as Dad does most of his
business online. Caine asked if he could play with the cardboard
boxes that the parts came in, and before you could say &#8220;Zoltar,&#8221; he
had constructed his own cardboard replica of several arcade-style
games, such as miniature pop-shot basketball and ring toss. He then
proceeded to sit in the store and wait for customers to play at his
arcade.</p>
<p class="c4">There weren&#8217;t many since foot traffic to the store
was sparse. One day, Mullick happened to stop by and became
entranced. He bought Caine&#8217;s premium &#8220;Fun Pass&#8221; and started coming
back for more games. He thought about a way to market the arcade
and put together a flash mob meet-up at the auto parts store, along
with a short 10-minute documentary video. The rest is thanks to the
Internet and a lot of people. You can watch the movie here:</p>
<p><span class="c5"><iframe src=
    "http://www.youtube.com/embed/faIFNkdq96U?wmode=transparent"
    allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="417" width=
    "500"></iframe></span></p>
<p class="c4">In the video, you&#8217;ll note that Caine has implemented
a sophisticated algorithm to ensure that his &#8220;Fun Pass&#8221; tickets are
authentic, using the square root function of a pocket calculator.
You&#8217;ve got to hand it to the kid. He has plenty of pluck.</p>
<p class="c4"><a href="http://CainesArcade.com">Mullick started a
  scholarship fund</a>, which has already topped $175,000 and is
still growing. And that doesn&#8217;t include a matching grant from the
Goldhirsh Foundation. Caine also has a Facebook fan page with
100,000 fans and a Twitter account with more than 6,000 followers.
To give his arcade an element of authenticity, Caine made his own
special logo T-shirt and is now selling it on the site. The movie
even has a theme song that you can download from iTunes (and it&#8217;s
another way to support the fund).</p>
<p class="c4">Plenty of media outlets have given Caine coverage,
including today&#8217;s New York Times and dozens of TV stations.
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2012/04/16/9-hidden-factors-of-caines-arcade-success/">
  Forbes did a story earlier this week</a> that details nine factors
of Caine and Mullick&#8217;s success that other entrepreneurs should
review. TJ McCue writes, &#8220;There is a certain allure in American
entrepreneur circles for turning waste in[to] wonder, of finding a
diamond in the rough, so to speak.&#8221; Another <a href=
  "http://www.forbes.com/sites/calebmelby/2012/04/12/9-reasons-why-the-9-year-old-founder-of-caines-arcade-will-be-a-billionaire-in-30-years/">
  Forbes columnist thinks Caine will be a billionaire in 30
  years.</a> Certainly, his star is rising. Another meme is born.</p>
<p class="c4">But more than a meme is what startups can learn from
this experience: Just because you only have one customer doesn&#8217;t
mean you aren&#8217;t in business, and you should treat every customer as
carefully as Caine did. The care he took in realizing his vision is
extraordinary, especially for someone so young. And understanding
the power of just one person to leverage various social media is
also key.</p>
<p class="c4">So if you are an entrepreneur looking for inspiration
today, check out the short video and read up on Caine&#8217;s Arcade. It
should get you thinking on how you too can create something from
your own passion, even if you are just nine years old.</p>
<p class="c4">As the lyrics to the theme song say, &#8220;It&#8217;s the best
cardboard arcade that has ever been made.&#8221; And that is something to
which we can all aspire.</p>
