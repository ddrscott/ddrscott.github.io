        </div>
        <p>The jury is still out on whether I can productively write
anything on a mobile device. I just received a Galaxy Note,
installed Hackers Keyboard, and installed Writer app. The Note
provides nearly an extra inch of keyboard while the Hackers
Keyboard provides all the typical keys on used to on a desktop.
Lastly was finding an app that highlights my favorite plain text
writing language, Markdown.</p>
<!-- more -->
<h2>The Galaxy Note</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Note is an interesting writing device due to its
size. I did get used to typing on my past Nexus S, but it was
always difficult to type code snippets. When the Galaxy Note
arrived the keyboard was comfy-cozzy and the screen could hold
double the text as my previous phones. I did have to make an
adjustment before I could make use of all those pixels.</p>
<h3>Set DPI of Android OS</h3>
<p>This is a multiple step process consisting of rooting, mounting
<code>/system</code> as read/write, and editing
<code>/system/build.info</code>. <a href=

http://www.google.com/search?btnG=1&amp;pws=0&amp;q=change+android+dpi</a></p>
<h2>Hacker&rsquo;s Keyboard</h2>
<p>This is the keyboard I&rsquo;ve always wanted but don&rsquo;t
have the time to create myself. It is based off the excellent
Gingerbread keyboard and adds the other keys to it. It does it in
such a way that doesn&rsquo;t make the QWERTY keys much small or
obfuscate the location of the symbol keys. My only complaint is
finding the &ldquo;/&rdquo; character. It is hidden behind a long
press of the Speak/Mic key.</p>
<p>In landscape mode the keyboard can turn into a full desktop
keyboard. I have it set to also not do amy typing correction and to
maintain screen overlay mode instead of demoting the screen layout
to show only the input box and the keyboard. Basically landscape is
my coding and SSH home, and portrait is for everything else.</p>
<h2>Writer&rsquo;s App</h2>
<p><a href=
"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamesmc.writer">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamesmc.writer</a>
I&rsquo;m writing this whole post in this app while reviewing it. I
have used other apps to write a substantial amount of text, but
this app has one feature that makes it worth while: Markdown syntax
highlighting. It might not mean a lot to most people out there, but
for me using Markdown means I don&rsquo;t have to worry about
styling my text are writing HTML tags and I still get to separate
sections with heads and annotate blocks as code or add
<strong>emphasis</strong> in an unobtrusive way. Having the syntax
highlighting humanizes the text into a readable document so I can
have a preview to how the final audience might see it as I&rsquo;m
still composing it.</p>
<h2>Misc Thoughts</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Note has a slippery back and makes holding the device over
45 degrees a difficult task without putting a finger or two under
the it. My pinky is very tired now and I think I&rsquo;m getting a
rash fromthw USB slot. A rubberized back is probably in order.</li>
<li>The Notes screen is too bright. I seldom use the device
outdoors where the brightness could be useful, but the real
complaint is I can turn the LCD backlighting low enough at night
time which is when I&rsquo;m most prone to write something. Using
an app like Screen Filter [<a href=
"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.haxor">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.haxor</a>]
helps but washes out colors.</li>
<li>Heat! This might be a feature in the winter, but right now my
hands are getting sweaty which makes thought #1 even more
evident.</li>
<li>Touch typing is possible. I&rsquo;ve been primarily looking a
the text that I&rsquo;m writing and not the kkeyboard. I occasionly
look at the ssuggestion strip for longer words, but with the Note I
finally get to make my high-school typing teacher happy by not
looking at my hands.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Uploading to Posterous</h2>
<p>Posterous is supposed ti be Blogging for the rest of us. Well it
isn&rsquo;t easy for me. The basis work flow in Posterous is to
email the post to <a href=
"mailto:post@posterous.com">post@posterous.com</a> and it
automatically gets to the web nicely formatted. This has yet to
turn out to my satisfaction because it usually messes up the code
snippets or doesn&rsquo;t feature an image I&rsquo;ve attatched.
This means I then have to go to there website and fiddle with it in
the WYSIWYG editor. I&rsquo;ll see what happens when I try to post
this Markdown heavy text.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, I feel the 3 way combo will allow me to write a bit
more. By nature, I would love to have more time in front of an IDE,
but writing English should do me some good, too.</p>
<p><strong>[Update]</strong> Uploading from Android app still
didn&rsquo;t format the original text correctly, I still had to
tweak in a web browser, ugh!</p>
