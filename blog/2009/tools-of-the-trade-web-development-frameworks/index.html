<br class="c3">
<p>New web development frameworks, promising rapid development and
easy deployment, are sprouting out at a more rapid pace than you
can keep up. In the last article, we looked at the various factors
you&#226;&#8364;&#8482;d have to consider when deciding on a
framework. Today, we are going to look at the various frameworks
available for each facet of web development.</p>
<p>In this current day and age, pushing out a finished, polished
application well before your competitor is key. Coding everything
from scratch, excluding even the mundane things, can be extremely
time consuming and makes the developer spend time reinventing the
wheel, time which would rather be spent implementing new features
or tightening up the code base. This is where web development
frameworks come in.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to take a look at the various options you
have when choosing a web development framework. We are going to
cover every type of framework, right from server side frameworks
down to JavaScript animation frameworks. Intrigued?
Let&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s go take a look!</p>
<h3>Server Side Frameworks</h3>
<p>Server side frameworks are the one doing almost all the heavy
lifting behind the application. They handle almost every aspect of
the application right from URL handling to database access. You
have a variety of options for each platform. For the sake of
brevity, we&#226;&#8364;&#8482;ll look at only the most popular
ones today.</p>
<h3>CakePHP</h3>
<div><a href="http://cakephp.org/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/cakephp.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>CakePHP is a very popular PHP framework inspired by Ruby on
Rails and lets you develop, maintain and deploy applications with
ease.</p>
<p>This framework makes use of the MVC pattern and has a lot of
must have features including ORM, scaffolding and URL routing. The
built in libraries are pretty expansive and include helpers for
generating RSS feeds and HTML elements.</p>
<p>There is little to no configuration needed to get it up running
and has an excellent community and detailed documentation behind
it.</p>
<h3>CodeIgniter</h3>
<div><a href="http://codeigniter.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/ci.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>CodeIgniter is a PHP framework built on the tenets of
simplicity, speed and a small footprint and as such is among the
smallest PHP libraries in terms of the total footprint.</p>
<p>Among the frameworks which are built on the MVC pattern, CI is
the easiest to learn. If you are a beginner PHP programmer,
CodeIgniter would be the best place to start with.</p>
<p>Since it aspires to be as small as possible, the libraries
aren&#226;&#8364;&#8482;t as full fledged as Cake but the extremely
thorough documentation and the very friendly community more than
make up for it.</p>
<h3>Kohana</h3>
<div><a href="http://www.kohanaphp.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/kohana.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Kohana is a fork of CodeIgniter intended to work only with PHP
5. Kohana is completely community driven and every modification is
thoroughly discussed and vetted with in the community.</p>
<p>All the positive aspects of CI carry over here except that the
documentation can be relatively lacking. However it has a thriving
community behind it you can turn to if you run into errors.</p>
<h3>Zend</h3>
<div><a href="http://framework.zend.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/zend.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Zend framework is more of a glue framework in that things
aren&#226;&#8364;&#8482;t as tightly coupled as in other frameworks
like RoR or CakePHP. As such it also gives you a lot more
control.</p>
<p>This framework boasts of one of the most complete collection of
utility classes to leverage in your application. But since this is
a collection of classes than a proper framework,
you&#226;&#8364;&#8482;ll be looking at lots of configuration to
make it work. If you are thinking of starting off as a PHP
programmer, this isn&#226;&#8364;&#8482;t the first framework you
should try.</p>
<p>Having said that, it has excellent documentation and a very
large community behind it.</p>
<h3>Symfony</h3>
<div><a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/sym.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Symfony is yet another very popular, feature packed PHP
framework. It provides a solid core and ships with a number of
third party libraries to fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>This is marketed primarily as an enterprise framework and has
solid documentation and a thriving community to help you.</p>
<h3>ASP.NET</h3>
<div><a href="http://www.asp.net/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/asp.net.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>ASP.NET allows you to leverage the MVC pattern through ASP.NET
MVC. It lets developers use the accepted MVC pattern in their
applications. Or if you chose to, you can completely ignore MVC and
use the way you&#226;&#8364;&#8482;d normally want to.</p>
<p>It ships with a very impressive set of features including
libraries for code generation. It also has very thorough
documentation and a welcoming community behind it.</p>
<h3>Ruby on Rails</h3>
<div><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/ror.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Ruby on Rails is a framework for the Ruby platform and was
created by David Hansson whilst creating Basecamp for 37Signals.
Ruby on Rails has gained incredible growth ever since it was
released.</p>
<p>RoR uses the MVC pattern and provides a number of features
including a complete ORM, scaffolding and URL rewriting. Ruby, by
default, uses Prototype as it&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s JavaScript
library.</p>
<p>Ruby&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s incredible growth can be attributed to
ease of development and rich feature set. Configuration is
generally minimal to nothing. It has good documentation and a
growing community.</p>
<h3>Django</h3>
<div><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/django.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Django is a web development framework based on Python and is
amongst the most robust one on the Python platform.</p>
<p>Django ships with an extensive library containing tools for
caching, serialization, authentication. It even provides a simple
administrative interface based on your models and controllers. Its
URL rewriting mechanism is a little different in that it uses
regular expression to resolve which controller it needs to use.</p>
<p>It has extremely thorough documentation to back it up along with
a helpful, polite community. A beginner Python programmer will take
to Django very easily.</p>
<h3>Pylons</h3>
<div><a href="http://pylonshq.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/pylons.jpg"
    alt="Tutorial Image"> border=&#8221;0&#8221; /&gt;</a></div>
<p>Similar to Zend, this is a very loosely coupled framework which
glues a number of third party libraries to provide
functionality.</p>
<p>In Pylons, each and every aspect can be switched out with the
one you like. Everything from it templating language to its ORM can
be switched out with minimal fuss.</p>
<p>With respect to features, it depends directly on the individual
components you pick for your project. Documentation can be
relatively lacking and the community is a little smaller too.</p>
<h3>TurboGears</h3>
<div><a href="http://turbogears.org/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/tg.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Similar to Kohana and CodeIgniter, Turbogears is built on top of
Pylons. It shares the same pros and cons as Pylons.</p>
<p>As with Pylons, every component of the framework can be replaced
with one of your own choosing. Currently it only uses Pylons for
its controller component.</p>
<h3>JavaScript Frameworks</h3>
<p>JavaScript frameworks work almost exclusively on the browser
side. A typical framework lets you navigate the DOM easier,
manipulate its contents right up to AJAX integration. There are a
couple of widget libraries too which let you use specific user
interface elements in your application instead of creating them
from scratch.</p>
<h3>jQuery</h3>
<div><a href="http://jquery.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/jquery.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>jQuery is an extremely popular library which focuses primarily
on DOM manipulation. It has an extensive API encompassing a range
of functionalities from DOM traversal to AJAX support.</p>
<p>It has very good documentation with a plethora of tutorials,
screencasts, references and books for you to go through. The
community is pretty large and very helpful.</p>
<p>If you are new to JavaScript and need to get started as quickly
as possible, jQuery is an excellent choice.</p>
<h3>Prototype</h3>
<div><a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/prototype.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Prototype is among the oldest JS libraries and as such is very
mature and stable. It ships with Ruby on Rails and as part of the
standard OS X installation.</p>
<p>It provides a clear API for all of the functionality it exposes
and has clear documentation to back it all up. Prototype also
provides various methods through which you can write clean class
based code. Prototype handles everything from DOM manipulation to
AJAX to providing a number of utility methods.</p>
<h3>MooTools</h3>
<div><a href="http://mootools.net/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/mootools.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Mootools presents itself as the ideal solution for the
intermediate to advanced programmer. It focuses on JavaScript as a
language and extends on it as much as possible.</p>
<p>It provides a robust class creation system just like Prototype
and just like the others, it provides a coherent API for all the
functionality it provides.</p>
<p>The documentation can be pretty lacking at times but the active
community more than makes up for it.</p>
<h3>Yahoo UI</h3>
<div><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/yui.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Yahoo UI library is a Swiss army kind of a library in that it
provides a complete set of features and widgets letting you build
the application you want to build. It is built by the developers at
Yahoo itself.</p>
<p>In YUI, the core library contains all the essential elements
including DOM traversal and CSS manipulation while the utilities
and widgets are optional and are available separately.</p>
<p>YUI has the most thorough documentation among JavaScript and is
easy to get started with.</p>
<h3>Dojo</h3>
<div><a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/dojo.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Dojo is yet another JS toolkit which provides everything that
you&#226;&#8364;&#8482;d expect from a modern JS library including
a selector engine, AJAX integration and so on.</p>
<p>It also provides a set of rich interface elements and a number
of advanced features like persistent connections and offline
storage. Dojo has very thorough documentation and a thriving
community.</p>
<h3>CSS Frameworks</h3>
<p>CSS frameworks, when properly used, let you cut down on
development time by cutting down on oft repeated declarations and
styling.</p>
<p>CSS frameworks can be a pretty polarizing topic among the
development community but you owe it to yourself to give it a
try.</p>
<h3>960Grid</h3>
<div><a href="http://960.gs/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/960.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>The 960 grid system intends to ease your workflow without
complicating things. There are 12 and 16 columns versions for added
choices.</p>
<p>It provides a CSS generator to further cut down on your
development time. It also has pre made templates for use in popular
software including Photoshop, Fireworks, Illustrator and Expression
Design.</p>
<h3>YAML</h3>
<div><a href="http://www.yaml.de/en/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/yaml.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>YAML, Yet Another Multi column Layout, is a CSS framework which
lets you create robust column based and/or grid based layout based
on web standards.</p>
<p>It also has a nifty tool for creating YAML CSS code. The
documentation is pretty thorough and the community, helpful.</p>
<h3>BluePrint</h3>
<div><a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/bp.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Blueprint is a CSS framework which intends to reduce the time
you spending mulling over grids and padding. It makes use of a
solid grid, support for typography and print support.</p>
<p>It features wiki based documentation and bug tracking. It boasts
an active community where you can post your queries.</p>
<h3>YUI Grids</h3>
<div><a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/" alt=
    "Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/yuigrids.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Yet another Yahoo products on the list. YUI Grids offers support
for multiple widths, fluid layouts, flexible element placement and
more.</p>
<p>As with the YUI JS library, each part of this is thoroughly
documented with plenty of examples, sample code and screen
casts</p>
<h3>Elastic</h3>
<div><a href="http://elasticss.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/elastic.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Elastic is a very simple framework with support for fixed,
liquid and elastic layouts.</p>
<p>Elastic has a growing community and pretty decent
documentation.</p>
<h3>JS Animation Frameworks</h3>
<p>Recently, specialized JS animation libraries have been popping
up with the sole purpose of providing easier way to animate user
interfaces. Let&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s a look at the most popular
ones.</p>
<h3>Scripty 2 and script.aculo.us</h3>
<div><a href="http://scripty2.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/s2.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Scripty and script.aculo.us are based on Prototype and provide a
way to seamlessly animate content as well as provide a number of
user interface elements to use in our applications.</p>
<h3>fx</h3>
<div><a href="http://fx.inetcat.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/fx.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>fx is a standalone JS library which focuses exclusively on
animation. As such it lets you animate each and every CSS property
along a set time line.</p>
<p>It has decent documentation and is extremely small at less than
4 kb.</p>
<h3>gx</h3>
<div><a href="http://gx.riccardodegni.net/docs" alt=
    "Link"><img src="http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/gx.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>gx is a cross browser framework which again focuses exclusively
on animation. It has a number of extremely impressive features
including easing, delayed animation and predefined animation
rules.</p>
<p>Since it is relatively new, the documentation is a little
lacking and the community is hard to find. But it is extremely
impressive and definitely warrants a try.</p>
<h3>Processing.JS</h3>
<div><a href="http://processingjs.org/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/processing.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Processing.js is built on the canvas element and written by John
Resig. It lets you draw elements and then manipulate them on the
canvas element.</p>
<p>Since it is a port of Processing for the JS language, it shares
most of its advantages including robust support animation
capability and shape support.</p>
<h3>jsAnim</h3>
<div><a href="http://www.jsanim.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/jsanim.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>jsAnim is yet another animation library which lets you create
very impressive animations. The example on the front page itself is
a wonderful example of what can be done with it.</p>
<p>It weights in at a hefty 25 kilobytes compared to 3.7 for fx but
packs a lot of features. The documentation is pretty straight
forward and should give you a good idea of the basics.</p>
<h3>Raphael</h3>
<div><a href="http://raphaeljs.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
    "http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/rjs.jpg"
    border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Raphael is a tiny library which lets you work with vector
elements on your web page. It uses SVG or VML as needed to generate
its graphics.</p>
<p>It&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s extremely robust and produces extremely
impressive results. A look through the demo pages gives you an idea
of what it is capable of.</p>
<p>The documentation is pretty thorough and the discussion group is
pretty active too.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>And we are done! We looked at all the choices you have when you
need to choose a web development framework. We looked at all types
of frameworks right from humongous server side frameworks to nimble
JS animation frameworks. Hopefully, this has been useful to you and
you found it interesting.</p>
