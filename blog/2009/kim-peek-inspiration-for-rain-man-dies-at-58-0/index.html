their disability.</p>

<a name="secondParagraph" id="secondParagraph"></a>
<p>The film won four Oscars, including best picture, best actor
and, for Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass, best original screenplay.
But it never would have been made if Mr. Morrow had not had a
chance meeting with Kim Peek, who inspired him to write the
film.</p>
<p>Mr. Peek was not autistic &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; not all savants
are autistic and not all autistics are savants &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
but he was born with severe brain abnormalities that impaired his
physical coordination and made ordinary reasoning difficult. He
could not dress himself or brush his teeth without help. He found
metaphoric language incomprehensible and conceptualization
baffling.</p>
<p>But with an astonishing skill that allowed him to read facing
pages of a book at once &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; one with each eye
&acirc;&euro;&rdquo; he read as many as 12,000 volumes. Even more
remarkable, he could remember what he had read.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Peek, who died Dec. 19 at home in Salt Lake City,
had perhaps the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s most capacious memory
for facts. He was 58. The cause was a heart attack, said his
father, Fran Peek.</p>
<p>Almost all documented savants &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; people with
an extraordinary depth of knowledge and the ability to recall it
&acirc;&euro;&rdquo; have been restricted in their expertise to
specific fields like mathematics, chess, art or music. But Mr. Peek
had a wide range of interests and could instantly answer the most
arcane questions on subjects as diverse as history, sports, music,
geography and movies.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;He was the Mount Everest of
memory,&acirc;&euro; Dr. Darold A. Treffert, an expert on savants
who knew Mr. Peek for 20 years, said in an interview.</p>
<p>Mr. Peek had memorized so many Shakespearean plays and musical
compositions and was such a stickler for accuracy, his father said,
that they had to stop attending performances because he would stand
up and correct the actors or the musicians.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;He&acirc;&euro;&trade;d stand up and say:
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;Wait a minute! The trombone is two notes
off,&acirc;&euro;&trade;&nbsp;&acirc;&euro; Fran Peek said.</p>
<p>Mr. Peek had an uncanny facility with the calendar.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;When an interviewer offered that he had been
born on March 31, 1956, Peek noted, in less than a second, that it
was a Saturday on Easter weekend,&acirc;&euro; Dr. Treffert and Dr.
Daniel D. Christensen wrote about Mr. Peek in Scientific American
in 2006.</p>
<p>They added: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;He knows all the area codes and
ZIP codes in the U.S., together with the television stations
serving those locales. He learns the maps in the front of phone
books and can provide MapQuest-like travel directions within any
major U.S. city or between any pair of them. He can identify
hundreds of classical compositions, tell when and where each was
composed and first performed, give the name of the composer and
many biographical details, and even discuss the formal and tonal
components of the music. Most intriguing of all, he appears to be
developing a new skill in middle life. Whereas before he could
merely talk about music, for the past two years he has been
learning to play it.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>Mr. Peek, who was dismissed as mentally retarded as a child and
later misdiagnosed as autistic, led a sheltered life, with few
people outside his family aware of his remarkable gifts. Then, in
1984, he met Mr. Morrow at a meeting of the Association of Retarded
Citizens in Arlington, Tex. Mr. Peek&acirc;&euro;&trade;s father
was chairman of the group&acirc;&euro;&trade;s communications
committee, and Mr. Morrow had helped create two television movies
about a retarded man named Bill (played by <a href=
"http://movies.nytimes.com/person/108826/Mickey-Rooney?inline=nyt-per"
title="">Mickey Rooney</a>).</p>
<p>After Mr. Peek displayed his memory skills in a conversation
with him, Mr. Morrow set about concocting a story around someone
like Kim Peek. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I was absolutely flabbergasted
that such a human being existed,&acirc;&euro; Mr. Morrow said in a
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2T45r5G3kA" title=
"&acirc;&euro;&oelig;The Real Rain Man&acirc;&euro;&oelig; documentary, via YouTube.">
2006 documentary about Mr. Peek</a>.</p>
<p>In &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Rain Man,&acirc;&euro; the autistic
character, Raymond Babbitt, has been institutionalized since he was
very young but is reunited with a cynical younger brother, Charlie
(played by <a href=
"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/tom_cruise/index.html?inline=nyt-per"
title="More articles about Tom Cruise.">Tom Cruise</a>), who had
forgotten about his brother&acirc;&euro;&trade;s existence. (The
title comes from Raymond&acirc;&euro;&trade;s recollection of the
infant Charlie&acirc;&euro;&trade;s name for him.) The two men take
a cross-country trip, and fraternal reconciliation ensues.</p>
<p>The movie, a critical and box office success, was not based on
Mr. Peek&acirc;&euro;&trade;s life, but in preparing for the role,
Mr. Hoffman visited with Mr. Peek and incorporated many of his
characteristics &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; a shambling gait, peculiar
hand movements and occasional blunt utterances &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
into the character of Raymond.</p>
<p>When Mr. Hoffman won an Oscar for best actor for the
performance, he thanked Mr. Peek in his acceptance speech. Mr.
Morrow went even further: he gave his own Oscar statuette to Mr.
Peek, who carried it with him to public appearances for the next 21
years.</p>
<p>In the wake of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Rain Man,&acirc;&euro; Mr.
Peek became something of a celebrity, emerging from his shell to
travel around the country giving demonstrations of his talent and
advocating tolerance for the disabled. Fran Peek estimated that
some 400,000 people have hugged Mr. Morrow&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
statuette.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;We called it the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
best-loved Oscar,&acirc;&euro; he said.</p>
<p>Laurence Kim Peek was born on Nov. 11, 1951. (He was named for
his mother&acirc;&euro;&trade;s favorite actor, <a href=
"http://movies.nytimes.com/person/1064439/Laurence-Olivier?inline=nyt-per"
title="">Laurence Olivier</a>, and the title character of <a href=
"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/rudyard_kipling/index.html?inline=nyt-per"
title="More articles about Rudyard Kipling.">Rudyard
Kipling</a>&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Kim&acirc;&euro;; Kipling was his
father&acirc;&euro;&trade;s favorite author.)
Kim&acirc;&euro;&trade;s head was enlarged, his cerebellum was
malformed and, perhaps most crucial, he was missing the corpus
callosum, the sheaf of nerve tissue that connects the
brain&acirc;&euro;&trade;s hemispheres. It has been theorized that
this disruption of normal communication between the
brain&acirc;&euro;&trade;s left and right halves resulted in a kind
of jury-rigged rewiring.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Perhaps the resulting structures allow the
two hemispheres to function, in certain respects, as one giant
hemisphere, putting normally separate functions under the same
roof, as it were,&acirc;&euro; Drs. Treffert and Christensen wrote.
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;If so, then Peek may owe some of his talents to
this particular abnormality.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>When Kim was 9 months old, a doctor said that he was so severely
retarded that he would never walk or talk and that he should be
institutionalized. When Kim was 6, another doctor recommended a
lobotomy. By then, however, Kim had read and memorized the first
eight volumes of a set of family encyclopedias, his father said. He
received part-time tutoring from the age of 7 and completed a high
school curriculum by 14. He spent great swaths of time absorbing
volumes in the Salt Lake City Public Library. He never used
computers, his father said.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;How he learned to read, I just
don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know,&acirc;&euro; Mr. Peek said.</p>
<p>Kim Peek&acirc;&euro;&trade;s parents divorced in 1981, and his
father cared for him alone until his son&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
death. Besides his father, Mr. Peek is survived by his mother,
Jeanne Willey Peek Buchi; a brother, Brian; and a sister, Alison,
all of Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Rain Man&acirc;&euro; changed Mr.
Peek&acirc;&euro;&trade;s life. In the documentary, he confessed
that before the film, he never looked anyone in the face.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Barry influenced me more than any other
person,&acirc;&euro; he said of Mr. Morrow. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;He
made me &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Rain
Man.&acirc;&euro;&trade;&nbsp;&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>Though his social skills never fully developed, he grew to be
outwardly engaging. He enjoyed being among people in his travels
and became comfortable as something of a showman. He began
developing mental skills he had never had before, like making puns;
his coordination slowly improved, to the extent that he could play
the piano. He became more self-aware, even displaying a certain
social agility.</p>
<p>During a presentation Mr. Peek gave at <a href=
"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/o/oxford_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org"
title="More articles about Oxford University">Oxford University</a>
in England, after he fielded students&acirc;&euro;&trade; questions
about the Lusitania and about British monarchs, a young woman stood
and asked him, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Kim, are you
happy?&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m happy just to look at
you,&acirc;&euro; Mr. Peek said.</p>
