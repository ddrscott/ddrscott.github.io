        Does not backing up at all count as the wrong way?

width="500">Time and time again, people tell me that they&#8217;ve bought
an external hard drive to back up their pictures, music, and
documents. Great, right? Sadly, that&#8217;s not always the case.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>There&#8217;s one simple rule about backups that everybody needs to
fully understand: <strong>Your files should exist in at least Two
  places, or it&#8217;s no longer a backup&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and your data
  is at risk.</strong> Too often people delete the files from their
primary PC, assuming they are backed up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to educate people on proper backup strategy, so we&#8217;ll
run through your options and talk about the pros and cons. These
days, you&#8217;ve got plenty of choices on the <a href=
  "http://lifehacker.com/398229/five-best-windows-backup-tools">Windows
  side of things</a>, Mac users have Time Machine, and there&#8217;s
<a href=
  "http://lifehacker.com/5405041/five-best-online-backup-tools">online
  backup for anybody</a>.</p>
<h3>Backing Up to a Local Source</h3>
<p><img src=
"http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/11/sshot-2009-11-16-11-05-53.jpg"
width="340">When it comes to local backup applications, it&#8217;s really
a matter of preference, since most of them do the job adequately
without a lot of fuss. The <a href=
  "http://lifehacker.com/5144757/first-look-at-windows-7s-backup-and-restore-center">
  Backup and Restore application built into Windows 7 or Vista</a> is
a perfectly acceptable choice, and will handle most backups with
ease. My personal choice is a paid version of <a href=
  "http://www.2brightsparks.com/syncback/syncback-hub.html">SyncBack
  SE</a>, but there&#8217;s <a href=
  "http://lifehacker.com/398229/five-best-windows-backup-tools">plenty
  of other choices</a> for Windows, and all of them do the job.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember when backing up your data
is that you can&#8217;t delete it from your main system once it&#8217;s been
backed up to an external drive. By doing that, you&#8217;ve left yourself
with only a single copy of your important files, on an external
drive that has just as much chance of dying as your internal PC
hard drive. Think it can&#8217;t happen to you? One of my external drives
died last week.</p>
<h3>Backing Up to an Online Source</h3>
<p><img src=
"http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/17/2009/11/thumb160x_sshot-2009-11-16-11-11-58.jpg"
width="158">There&#8217;s <a href=
  "http://lifehacker.com/5405041/five-best-online-backup-tools">quite
  a few online backup services to choose from</a>, and while the
great thing about online backup is that you don&#8217;t have to deal with
external drives, you&#8217;re leaving your data in somebody else&#8217;s hands,
and restoring all of your files can take an extremely long time,
since you&#8217;ll have to download all of the files again. If you don&#8217;t
have a ton of personal files, online backup is a great choice, if
you don&#8217;t mind putting your faith in somebody else to keep your
data secure.</p>
<h3>Backing Up a Total System Image</h3>
<p><img src=
"http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/11/sshot-2009-11-16-11-40-39.jpg"
width="340">Without question, the easiest form of backup to restore
from is a complete image of your system. We&#8217;ve already covered a
list of the <a href=
  "http://lifehacker.com/5303067/five-best-free-system-restore-tools">
  best free system restore tools</a>, and Gina walked through how to
<a href=
  "http://lifehacker.com/326086/hot-image-your-pcs-hard-drive-with-driveimage-xml">
  hot image your PC hard drive with DriveImage XML</a>, but if you
really want an easy experience you might want to check out one of
the paid tools like <a href=
  "http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/trueimage/">Acronis
  True Image</a>.</p>
<p>These tools are the best way to recover from a total system
failure, but they usually aren&#8217;t quite as easy to restore a single
file from, which is a much more likely scenario. There&#8217;s been
dozens of times that I&#8217;ve needed to restore an older version of a
document, and was able to easily grab the previous version from
Dropbox or my external drive.</p>
<h3>What Should You Back Up?</h3>
<p><img src=
"http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/11/sshot-2009-11-16-11-29-20.jpg"
width="340">When you&#8217;re backing up your files, there&#8217;s no reason to
make a backup of every single thing on your hard drive-in fact, it
would be a huge waste of space to back up your Windows folder if
you have to reinstall the whole system in order to restore the
backups again. Here&#8217;s a couple of pointers to help you choose what
you really need to back up, and what you don&#8217;t:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Your entire Users folder:</strong> either at
  C:\Users\Username for Windows 7 or Vista, or C:\Documents and
  Settings\ for Windows XP. This folder should contain all of your
  documents, settings, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Your Data Folders:</strong> If you&#8217;ve created other
  data on your hard drives, you should include those as well.</li>
</ul>
<br>
What you don&#8217;t need to back up?
<ul>
  <li><strong>Your Program Files Folder:</strong> There&#8217;s simply no
  reason to back up your installed applications when they all have to
  be re-installed if you had to restore your machine. It&#8217;s a waste of
  space to do so.</li>
  <li><strong>Your Windows Folder:</strong> The only real good reason
  to back up your Windows folder is just in case you can&#8217;t find the
  same drivers again. On the other hand, there are <a href=
    "http://lifehacker.com/5102344/driverbackup2-copies-your-system-drivers">
    any number</a> <a href=
    "http://lifehacker.com/399097/double-driver-backs-up-your-systems-drivers">
    of tools</a> to <a href=
    "http://lifehacker.com/224599/download-of-the-day-driver-collector-windows">
    back up your drivers</a>, and you should do that once in a while
  instead of backing up the entire Windows folder.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Backup Strategy: Combo</h3>
<p>Your best bet is to combine a number of different methods into
your backup strategy.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Create a System Image:</strong> Use one of the many
  system restore tools to create a complete image of your PC, which
  will protect you in case of a catastrophic system failure. You&#8217;ll
  want to back this up to your external drive.</li>
  <li><strong>Use a Backup Tool:</strong> Just pick one, any one, and
  start using it. Back up your data to an external drive, another PC,
  or anywhere else. Just make sure you don&#8217;t delete the data from the
  primary PC.</li>
  <li><strong>Use an Online Backup for Important Files:</strong> Even
  though you are backing up to an external drive, you might want to
  start using something like Dropbox or Mozy to back up your most
  important files.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Just remember, all of your files need to be in at least Two places
at once. You don&#8217;t want to get <a href=
