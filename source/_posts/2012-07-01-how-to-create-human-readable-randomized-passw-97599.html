<div>This issue came up in my day job where the client didn't like
our password reset passwords. They said it was too random and
people can't remember it long enough between reading it in there
email and entering it into our app/website.This might be a matter
of taste since sending out a password change link is another common
solution, but we don't have that flow in our existing
implementation. Generating a less random temporary password is the
quicker solution.So the method we chose was to pick a random 4
letter word from a dictionary file and append a number to the end
of it.We found a hacker's dictionary online and used that as our
base.<br>
To restrict it to just 4 letter words I ran:<br>
[code type="ruby"]<br>
cat en-US.dict | ruby -ne 't = $_.strip; puts t if t =~ /^\w{4}$/'
&gt; passwd.dict<br>
[/code]The next part was the random selection.To restrict it to
just 4 letter words I ran:<br>
[code type="ruby"]<br>
def random_passwd<br>
&Acirc;&nbsp; words = File.read('passwd.dict').split<br>
&Acirc;&nbsp; word = words[(rand * words.size).to_i]<br>
&Acirc;&nbsp; num = (rand * 8).to_i + 2&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; #
number between 2 and 8<br>
&Acirc;&nbsp; word + num.to_s<br>
end<br>
[/code]That's about it.Some points of interest might be:<br></div>
<ol>
<li>The file read maybe cached, but all the 4 letter words in the
English language was only ~2500, and the cost of reading the file
was less than a a millisecond.</li>
<li>The passwd.dict file has an extra line feed at the end so we
took that out manually. We were editing the file anyway to remove
the potentially offensive 4 letter words.</li>
<li>The regex can be changed to taste, but we figured 4 letter
words are easily remembered.</li>
<li>In our actual implementation of we further restrict the word
list so the words can't end in "l" or "o" so the user wouldn't
confuse them with numbers. This is the same reason we don't pick a
random number starting with 0 or 1.</li>
<li>You'll most certainly want to force the user to change the
password after entering this one. The whole point was to have a
weak password so the user could remember and type it.</li>
</ol>
<div>Hope this can be helpful to some one out there.<br></div>
