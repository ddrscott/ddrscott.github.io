side mirrors doesn't actually cover the blind spot outside the
driver's vision. Car and Driver illustrates a car mirror setup
that, once you get used to it, could prevent lane change
freak-outs.</p>
<p>The auto magazine culls its mirror alignment diagram from a
paper published in 1995 by the Society of Automotive Engineers
(SAE). That paper suggested, basically, moving your side mirrors to
point further out into adjacent lanes, a trick that can take some
getting used to:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>The paper advocates adjusting the mirrors so far outward that
the viewing angle of the side mirrors just overlaps that of the
cabin's rearview mirror. This can be disorienting for drivers used
to seeing the flanks of their own car in the side mirrors. But when
correctly positioned, the mirrors negate a car's blind spots. This
obviates the need to glance over your shoulder to safely change
lanes as well as the need for an expensive blind-spot warning
system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the trick is to get the side mirrors aligned <em>just</em>
outside what your rearview mirror covers, and rely on your own
vision to cover the areas in your peripheral vision. Neat trick,
but as the magazine (and their commenters) mention, you'll want to
train yourself on a neighborhood road before taking this setup out
on the interstate.</p>
<p>Check out the Car and Driver post for a full look and
explanation of the SAE-approved side mirror setup. Got a better
solution to your side mirror setup? Do tell in the comments.
