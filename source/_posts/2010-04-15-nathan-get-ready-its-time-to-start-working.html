It's Never Too Early To Get Your Child Her First Cubicle</a></div>

<p>If you have a child, you want him or her to be prepared for the
future. So why not begin their dreary cubicle farm confinement
before they even learn how to read? That's what the Little Tykes
Young Explorer does, combining a home cubicle and child-sized
seating with a computer loaded with kid-friendly software, all at a
rather inflated price. Which is a lot like real office furniture,
come to think of it.</p>
<p>The Young Explorer costs $2,599. What that get you?</p>
<p><strong>Furniture features:</strong><br></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Flat desk area</li>
<li class="c4"><br></li>

supplies</li>
<li class="c4"><br></li>
<li>Two locking cabinet doors</li>
<li class="c4"><br></li>
<li>Computer wiring stores safely inside ventilated cabinet.</li>
<li class="c4"><br></li>
<li>Locking castors keep unit from rolling during use.</li>
<li class="c4"><strong>Computer equipment features:</strong><br>

<ul>
<li>Millie's Math House&Acirc;&reg;</li>
<li>Sammy's Science House&Acirc;&reg;</li>
<li>Bailey's Book House&Acirc;&reg;</li>
<li>Trudy's Time and Place&Acirc;&reg;</li>
<li>Thinkin' Things&Acirc;&reg;</li>
</ul>
<p>The set appears to be geared for schools, libraries, day care
centers, and the like, but it's funnier to think of it as the
white-collar cousin to the <a href=

McDonald's cashier playset</a>.</p>
<p>Considering that ThinkCentre PCs start at around $350 for the
base model, and you can get a more attractive child's computer desk
for a few hundred bucks (or even less) this becomes an even more
baffling product.</p>
