I've created a working version of the sumo and it is revealing some
overall bugs for the game engine at large.<br>
First the precision of two touch points greatly decreases when they
are close together I presume this is an issue with capacitive
screens and not a software issue. This issue hasn't shown itself
till now since the other games are faster paced and acurracy is
less important.

Second issue is motion jitters. This occurs when hold a target
object in place. One would expect the item to never move, but thats
not what happens. After a few seconds the held piece will violently
spring around the touch point. This happens due to how the touch
sensor provides me the information. I get touch events in 3 main
categories: down, move, and up. (I'm specifically ignoring cancel
for now.) On down I add a heavy mass to the touched object. This
makes it practically immobile from impacts by other objects. When I
get a move event I add linear velocity to the object so it can
shift to the touched coordinate. If the finger is down and but
never moves, I don't get any other events from the sensor which
tell me that it's still down. I need to rely on an up event to
negate the down. Unfortunately, I don't always get the up event or
even the cancel .......
