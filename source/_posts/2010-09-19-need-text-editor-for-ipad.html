Need Text Editor for iPad Well a dug around again for a test editor
on the iPad and came up empty handed again. I've been using vim
more and more and think I'm almost to the point where I can live in
it for my non coding endeavors, but I can't seem to find something
like it on the iPad. I did consider using iSSH but that would
require me to connect to a server that has it, and I'm not always
connected. I think I'm just going to have to live with working in
notes for now.<br>
I also looked at Bespin from Mozilla which has been renamed to
Skywritter. The project seems promising and the transition from a
cloud based services to a JavaScript editor feels right. This also
reminds me CodeMirror, a project that's also doing JavaScript code
editing, but that never quite worked out for me.<br>
The dream is to one day manage and update a server remotely and not
need to pull down source to make changes. It could be interesting
to have a server do some of the heavy lifting of a project. For
instance, maybe do some continual integration or keep a strong
index of changes as they are being made. It would also be
interesting to do some of the things that Google Wave did but with
code. I can imaging 2 people pairing on code remotely making
adjustments on the fly. Let one person write the main line, and the
spotter makes the minor fixes along the way. There are plenty of
other things that would make collaboration difficult like resolving
code conflicts or what happens when some one changes the signature
of a method that your using. But I think a lot of these are just
tweaks to existing collaboration issues, and not super sized road
blocks.<br>
Back to the real world, I just hope to find a nice text editor for
the iPad so I can get my fixed with fonts back along with auto
indentation and some syntax highlighting.
