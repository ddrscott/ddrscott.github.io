<p>After struggling with this problem for quite some time, I think
the issue is finally licked. The problem relates to transferring
you fingers momentum to a virtual object on the screen. The natural
way to display finger position is to plot a sprite at the touch
sensors coordinates. The problem with this method is the physics
engine doesn't think their is any momentum built up. The physics
engine just thinks your finger teleported there. So if I teleport
on top of a cow it just explodes. To make things worse if the touch
events come in too slowly you'll teleport over the cow completely
missing the free lunch.</p>
<p>The initial solution I had for the issue was horrible. I figured
I could plot the sprite at the point of contact like before, then
calculate a force vector based on the last coordinate form the
previous touch event, divide by time and then tell the physics
engine to apply the force to the target. This gave me accurate
transfer of momentum, but looked ridiculous. The finger sprite kept
jumping forward as I moved my finger across the screen like a
horizontal jack hammer. So I thought I could divorce the finger
sprite from the physics engine, but then I'd have to keep track of
more objects and states of when to use physics (during a release)
and when to not use it (during a drag). Anyway, I chose not to go
down that path mainly because it felt like too many parts and I
have no time for debugging AND I was still teleporting. Doh!</p>
<p>The solution ultimately came to something very unnatural, but
completely sufficient. And it cut down my code significantly.
Probably in half. The affect I needed was to have the object I'm
dragging show up at my finger location and have momentum maintained
at release or collision. Did you catch that word? Dragging? That's
how it hit me. The previous solution was to push the object, but if
I drag it things get simpler. In drag mode I just need to apply
enough force to the object to get it to my finger location. The
math for that is simple and the same as I mentioned in the first
solution: (current finger sprite position - current touch position)
/ time. When I apply the force, the physics engine moves the sprite
under my finger perfectly, and if it misses the next touch event
comes in to get it even closer. It a self correcting system.</p>
<p>The best part of the final solution is no more teleporting. We
don't do it in real life and we shouldn't do it in our games
either. Maybe one day I'll add the complexity to push the object
instead of drag, but for now I'll leave that as an exercise to the
reader.</p>
