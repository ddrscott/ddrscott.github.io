12 Interesting Upcoming Ruby and Rails Events (That Aren&rsquo;t
Sold Out)</a></div>

<p>Wanted to go to <a href="http://jrubyconf.com/">JRubyConf</a> or
<a href="http://www.rubyconf.org/">RubyConf</a> this year? Tough -
they're sold out already. Luckily, though, there are some
interesting upcoming events that you <i>can</i> still get in to -
some online, some in multiple cities, some held in youth centers,
some in hotels, and even one on a tropical island. Whew!</p>
<h3>Free "Optimizing Your Online Store" Webinar (Online; September
24, 2009)</h3>

<p>New Relic is running <a href="http://www.newrelic.com/webinar">a
free webinar event</a> on Thursday, September 24 for developers and
customers interested in optimizing e-commerce sites ready for the
2009 holiday season. The webinar will feature New Relic customer
<i>SheetMusicPlus.com</i> and will provide tips for getting your
online store prepared.</p>
<p>Naturally, being a New Relic event, the focus will be on New
Relic's RPM product and a special webinar-only discount will be
offered. Given the quality of New Relic's other materials though, I
doubt it's going to be a sales pitch from start to finish. <a href=

<h3>RubyFoo (London, UK; October 2-3, 2009)</h3>
<p class="c5"><img src=

height="37" alt="rubyfoo.png" class="c4" width="139"></p>
<p><b><a href="http://jaoo.dk/ruby-london-2009/">RubyFoo</a></b> is
a Ruby conference taking place in London in October, 2009. It's
being put on by Trifork, the company behind the successful JAOO
developer conferences. RubyFoo is a sort of follow up to the
RubyFools conference they put on in Copenhagen, Denmark last year.
Speakers include Sam Aaron, Ola Bini (JRuby), Adam Wiggins, Aslak
Hellesoy, and Matz, and the general theme of the conference is
"communicative programming." <b>Note: You can use the promotion
code of "<i>Rubyinside</i>" to get &Acirc;&pound;50 off
registration.</b></p>
<h3>Rails Roadshow (USA; October and November, 2009)</h3>
<p><img src=
"http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/railsroadshow.png"
height="76" alt="railsroadshow.png" class="c4" width="114">The
<a href="http://www.railsroadshow.com/"><b>Rails Roadshow</b></a>
is a series of five free events being organized by esteemed Rails
hosting company <i>Engine Yard</i>. In order:</p>
<ul>
<li>October 26 - <i>Boston, MA</i></li>
<li>October 27 - <i>Chicago, IL</i></li>
<li>October 29 - <i>Austin, TX</i></li>
<li>October 30 - <i>Los Angeles, CA</i></li>
<li>November 2 - <i>Seattle, WA</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite being an Engine Yard-heavy event, the schedule is quite
varied with speakers from Amazon, New Relic, and CVSDude in
addition to those from Engine Yard. The theme is "performance in
the cloud." For free, it seems like a nice morning out (the event
finishes at midday) and you get breakfast - what's not to like?</p>
<h3>Aloha On Rails (Hawaii; October 4-6, 2009)</h3>
<p><b><img src=
"http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/aloha.png"
height="51" alt="aloha.png" class="c4" width="116"></b><b><a href=
"http://www.alohaonrails.com/">Aloha on Rails</a></b> is a brave
new entry to the Rails conference circuit, taking place in Hawaii
in early October. If you've always wanted to try and get a Hawaii
vacation on the company dime, this is the time to build up your
powers of persuasion. The conference bills itself as "the premier
destination event for Ruby on Rails and Web development" and
promises three unique days (2 for conference, 1 for tutorials) of
Ruby and Rails related fun.<br>
The speaker list for Aloha is pretty significant. Names include
Chad Fowler, Obie Fernandez, Gregg Pollack, Desi McAdam, Charles
Nutter, Yehuda Katz, Sarah Mei, Tammer Saleh, Chad Pytel, Blake
Mizerany, Pat Maddox, and Ezra Zygmuntowicz.. and that's only the
start of it - <a href="http://www.alohaonrails.com/speakers/">see
all of them</a>.</p>

<h3>Rails Summit Latin America 2009 (S&Atilde;&pound;o Paulo,
Brazil; October 13-14, 2009)</h3>
<p><a href=
"http://railssummit.locaweb.com.br/en/pages/home"><b>Rails Summit
Latin America</b></a> comes back for a second run in 2009 - taking
place between October 13-14 in sunny S&Atilde;&pound;o Paulo,
Brazil. Last year's event attracted 550 attendees, so for a
regional Ruby/Rails conference it did amazingly. This year it costs
400 Brazilian Real to attend (about $200).</p>
<p>Speakers lined up to speak so far include Bryan Liles, Carlos
Brando, Chad Fowler, Gregg Pollack, Ilya Grigorik, Jason Seifer,
Matt Aimonetti, Obie Fernandez, Pratik Naik, Rich Kilmer, and
several prominent South American Rubyists. It's a bit of an
all-star affair!</p>

height="62" alt="railscamp.png" class="c4" width="85"></p>
<h3>Rails Camps (Margate, UK and Melbourne, Australia; October /
November 2009)</h3>
<p><a href="http://railscamps.com/"><b>Rails Camps</b></a> is a
series of Rails related get-togethers, run in a lo-fi style in,
usually, Australia and the United Kingdom. Two Rails Camps are on
the calendar for late 2009. The <a href=
"http://railscamps.com/#uk_october_2009">first</a> in Margate, UK
(an interesting seaside resort, to say the least) on October 16-19
and the <a href=
"http://railscamps.com/#au_november_2009">second</a> in Melbourne,
Australia on November 20-23. Previous reports show that these
events seem to go down really well, especially if you want to get
away from it all for a few days and hang out with fellow geeks - so
check it out.</p>
<h3>RubyEnRails (Amsterdam, Netherlands; October 30-31, 2009)</h3>
<p><img src=
"http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/rer2009.png"
height="62" alt="rer2009.png" class="c4" width="128"></p>
<p>Where Euruko is Europe's equivalent of RubyConf, <a href=
"http://2009.rubyenrails.nl/?locale=en">RubyEnRails</a> is starting
to look like Europe's answer to RailsConf. This year, RubyEnRails
takes place in Amsterdam on October 30 and 31 and speakers include
Jeremy Kemper, Yehuda Katz, Jonathan Weiss, Eloy Duran, Bart ten
Brinke, Willen van Bergen, and Edwin Vlieg. It only costs 79 euro
(about $120 or &Acirc;&pound;70) and it sounds like it's been a fun
event in previous years.</p>
<p class="c6">Note: I always seem to miss some awesome events in
these roundups so, as always, please leave comments recommending
your own events, those I've forgotten, etc.</p>
