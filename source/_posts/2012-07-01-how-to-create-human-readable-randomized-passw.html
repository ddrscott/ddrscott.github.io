<p>This issue came up in my day job where the client didn&rsquo;t
like our password reset passwords. They said it was too random and
people can&rsquo;t remember it long enough between reading it in
there email and entering it into our app/website.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>This might be a matter of taste since sending out a password
change link is another common solution, but we don&rsquo;t have
that flow in our existing implementation. Generating a less random
temporary password is the quicker solution.</p>
<p>So the method we chose was to pick a random 4 letter word from a
dictionary file and append a number to the end of it.</p>
<p>We found a hacker&rsquo;s dictionary online and used that as our
base. To restrict it to just 4 letter words I ran:</p>
<div class="CodeRay code">
<pre>
cat en-<span class=
"constant">US</span>.dict | ruby -ne <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">t = $_.strip; puts t if t =~ /^</span><span class="content">\w</span><span class="content">{4}$/</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span> &gt; passwd.dict
</pre></div>
<h2>What is this doing?</h2>
<p>(skip this if your already familiar with Bash and Ruby)</p>
<ol>
<li><code>cat en-US.dict</code> print the contents of en-US.dict to
stdout.</li>
<li><code>| ruby -ne '...'</code> direct to output of
<code>cat</code> into <code>ruby</code>. a. <code>-n</code> tells
<code>ruby</code> to iterate through all the lines and set the
global <code>$_</code> variable to the current line. b.
<code>e</code> tells <code>ruby</code> to execute the next argument
as a <code>ruby</code> script</li>
<li><code>t = $_.strip</code> remove any leading or trailing
whitespace and set it to variable <code>t</code></li>
<li><code>;</code> ruby line separator so we can do this as a one
liner</li>
<li><code>puts t</code> print the value of <code>t</code></li>
<li><code>if t =~</code> only execute the previous line <code>puts
t</code> if <code>t</code> matches the following regular
expression.</li>
<li><code>/^\w{4}$/</code> this is a regular expression that
matches any <code>t</code> which contains exactly 4 characters
between [a-z] and [A-Z]</li>
<li><code>&gt; passwd.dict</code> redirect anything which was
<code>puts</code> by step 5 into a file named
<code>passwd.dict</code></li>
</ol>
<h2>Random Word Selection</h2>
<p>The next part was the random selection. It isn&rsquo;t that
fancy, but I figured I shouldn&rsquo;t leave it out.</p>
<p>To restrict it to just 4 letter words I ran:</p>
<div class="CodeRay code">
<pre>
<span class="keyword">def</span> <span class=
"function">random_passwd</span>
  words = <span class="constant">File</span>.read(<span class=
"string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class=
"content">passwd.dict</span><span class=
"delimiter">'</span></span>).split  <span class=
"comment"># read the contents of passwd.dict and</span>
                                          <span class=
"comment"># convert it into an array. 1 element per word.</span>

  word = words[(rand * words.size).to_i]  <span class=
"comment"># pick a random element.</span>
  num = (rand * <span class="integer">8</span>).to_i + <span class=
"integer">2</span>               <span class=
"comment"># pick number between 2 and 8.</span>
  word + num.to_s                         <span class=
"comment"># concatenate the two strings together.</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<h2>Misc Points of Interest</h2>
<ol>
<li>The file read maybe cached, but all the 4 letter words in the
English language was only ~2500, and the cost of reading the file
was less than a a millisecond.</li>
<li>The passwd.dict file has an extra line feed at the end so we
took that out manually. We were editing the file anyway to remove
the potentially offensive 4 letter words.</li>
<li>The regex can be changed to taste, but we figured 4 letter
words are easily remembered.</li>
<li>In our actual implementation, we further restrict the word list
so the words can&rsquo;t end in &ldquo;l&rdquo; or &ldquo;o&rdquo;
so the user wouldn&rsquo;t confuse them with numbers. This is the
same reason we don&rsquo;t pick a random number starting with 0 or
1.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll most certainly want to force the user to change
the password after entering this one. The whole point was to have a
weak password so the user could remember and type it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this can be helpful to some one out there.</p>
