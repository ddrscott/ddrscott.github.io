<p>Tricked by YouTube again. This video series really teaches
something instead of just saying how easy it is to learn. I like
how this instructor needs to reference the sheet music later in the
series. He is human after all.</p>
<p>Hopefully one day I'll be good enough to actually apply these
principles and it would make a real difference to my technique.
Until then it's back to reading sheet music for me.</p>
