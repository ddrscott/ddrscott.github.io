Why just for Christmas? How about 4th of July? Mardi Gras?If time
allows (which it doesn't), this will be my next home project.

<p>As he explains:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
  <p>Christmas Light Hero is using 7 light controllers from
  Light-O-Rama built from kits to control 21,268 lights and LEDs.
  Each controller has 16 outputs and 2-3 TTL level control inputs
  that are used by the game system to fire different programmed light
  sequences depending on what happens in the game. It relies on the
  fact that the game sequence is very consistent. If the game and the
  lighting sequences start together, they will stay in very good sync
  through the length of the song. The light program allows branching
  and overlays for fail, star power and "ready." I have some ideas to
  automate the initial show/game sync, but for now you have to push
  doorbell buttons at the right moments.</p>

<p>Rubberneckers watching in their cars can tune into the frequency
99.1 to hear the audio, or even partake in the fun if they dare.
