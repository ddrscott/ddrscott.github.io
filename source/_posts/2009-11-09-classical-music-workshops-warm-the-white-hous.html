Maybe one day with enough practice, I'll be able to play there. I
didn't see a kazoo being featured.

<p>Last Wednesday, the White House welcomed 120 middle and high
school music students from all over the country to participate in
four different engaging workshops. &Acirc;&nbsp;From the Blue Room
to the Map Room and the East Room to the Diplomatic Reception Room,
beautiful music and instructors' guiding voices echoed through the
halls of this historic home.&Acirc;&nbsp; Aspiring students plucked
their bows and strummed the strings of their guitars, while picking
up tips and queues from their instructors, renowned classical
musicians Awadagin Pratt on the piano, Joshua Bell on violin,
Sharon Isbin with classical guitar, and Alisa Weilerstein on
cello.</p>

<p>In her session, Ms. Weilerstein posed a question to her
students. "How do we get someone excited about classical music?"
she asked. &Acirc;&nbsp;Bright young minds quickly offered up a
number of ideas. "Use classical instruments to play modern pieces,"
said one young lady. "Play Classical music for people who've never
heard it," said another. As the students listened to each
other&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ideas, they also talked about the
opportunities they had to discover magic through music; they
discussed the importance of keeping music education in schools and
communities, where all children would have an opportunity to
discover these great art forms just like they did.</p>
<p>As the workshops concluded, everyone gathered in the historic
East Room for a concert put on by their four
instructors.&Acirc;&nbsp; First Lady Michelle Obama made a special
visit, and told the students that through music, "You'll learn that
if you believe in yourself and put in your best effort, that
there's nothing you can't achieve; and those aren't just lessons
about music, these are really lessons about life."</p>
<p>It was a privilege to welcome so many young musicians living
such talented and full lives on a beautiful fall day at the
people's house.&Acirc;&nbsp; The White House is honored to share
these experiences with all students. Check out all the video:</p>
