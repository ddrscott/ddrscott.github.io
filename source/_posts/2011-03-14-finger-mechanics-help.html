I am finding it near impossible to get a perfect simulation of
finger to table top physics. I'm not sure if this is a hardware
limitation or just my bad algorithm. In a previous post I had a
workable solution by dragging pieces around instead of teleporting,
and that does work enough. But now that the game is released I feel
the need to make is better.

The issue with dragging is the delay that is percieved when moving
the object around very quickly. It looks like the object is chasing
your finger which breaks the illusion. Fortunately, none of the
mini-games use swirling but it bugs me in the Free Play mode.<br>
In the real world, we can put two coins on a table and push one
coins into the other. On a touch screen the coordinates come in
after the push which is already too late for a perfect sim. So I
think some predictive algorithm is in need.<br>
If I can take a previous position and the current I should be able
to predict the next and push the object there directly. Sadly, this
type of math is my worst suit and I don't have the time to figure
it out. If anyone out there lives and breathes math, feel free to
comment with a solution. Otherwise the whole word will have to play
with drag physics or play a different game. Sad.
