<p>I'm sick of small "sexy" devices. I want a full screen every
where I go. So I want some one to make this for us, and get a big
celebrity to sport it and make it cool. I know I can't pull it off
alone.</p>
<p>I'm hoping the future Galaxy Note/Tab 3.0 can be hugged by
Backpocket 2.0's embrace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what do you think tech boys and girls? Leave your comments

<p><strong>[Update]</strong></p>
<p>Aparently another company has already made a large pocket, but
hasn't put it on the back yet.&nbsp;<a href=
