Just updated to the trunk build of AndEngine which broke almost
every line of code I had. There were a bunch of renamings that
occurred to replace the concept of scene layers with a more generic
child entity structure. The shape modifiers also got moved to
another package to differentiate from particle modifiers.<br>
All in all, the transition was smooth and I will now be able to
contribute to code back into the main source tree without as many
conflicts.
