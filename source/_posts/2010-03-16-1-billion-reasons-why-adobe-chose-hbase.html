1 Billion Reasons Why Adobe Chose HBase</a></div>

<p>Cosmin Lehene &iuml;&raquo;&iquest;wrote two excellent articles
on Adobe's experiences with HBase: <a href=
"http://hstack.org/why-were-using-hbase-part-1/">Why
we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re using HBase: Part 1</a> and <a href=
"http://hstack.org/why-were-using-hbase-part-2/">Why
we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re using HBase: Part 2</a>. Adobe needed a
<em>generic,</em> <em>real-time, structured data storage and
processing system that could handle any data volume, with access
times under 50ms, with no downtime and</em> no data loss. The
article goes into great detail about their experiences with HBase
and their evaluation process, providing a "well reasoned impartial
use case from a commercial user". It talks about failure handling,
availability, write performance, read performance, random reads,
sequential scans, and consistency.&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the knocks against HBase has been it's complexity, as it
has many parts that need installation and configuration. All is not
lost according to the Adobe team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HBase is more complex than other systems (you need Hadoop,
Zookeeper, cluster machines have multiple roles). We believe that
for HBase, this is not accidental complexity and that the argument
that &acirc;&euro;&oelig;HBase is not a good choice because it is
complex&acirc;&euro; is irrelevant. The advantages far outweigh the
problems. Relying on decoupled components plays nice with the Unix
philosophy: do one thing and do it well. Distributed storage is
delegated to HDFS, so is distributed processing, cluster state goes
to Zookeeper. All these systems are developed and tested
separately, and are good at what they do. More than that, this
allows you to scale your cluster on separate vectors. This is not
optimal, but it&Acirc;&nbsp;<strong>allows for incremental
investment</strong> in either spindles, CPU or RAM. You
don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have to add them all at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Highly recommended, especially if you need some sort of balance
to the recent gush of Cassandra articles.&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>
