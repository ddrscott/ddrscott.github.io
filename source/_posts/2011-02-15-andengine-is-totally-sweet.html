<p>Here's the result of a couple hours of work. The cards are
touchable<br>
and you can move more than one card at a time. The engine allows me
to<br>
hold a card under each finger and rotate my phone in a 360 and
it<br>
tracks my fingers perfectly. I was able to stitch together the
basic<br>
functions because of the numerous example provided by<br>

Now I can image my game coming together in my lifetime. Thanks
Nicolas Gramlich for making such an amazing product and open<br>
sourcing it to the world. AndEngine is a product that I plan on<br>
contributing to in the future.
