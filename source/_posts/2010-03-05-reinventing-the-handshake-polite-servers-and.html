This would be great. I never want to setup another VPN firewall
ever again.

    Reinventing the Handshake: Polite Servers and Smart Networks Lead
    to Active Security</a></div>

real-time tag cloud for the RSA conference this year, three words
would be in big bold letters: Security (of course), Cloud, and
Virtualization. Paul Congdon, from HP's ProCurve Networking group
gave us a view into the not-so-distant future where servers, like
good house guests, knock before entering. In this case, it's the
link they request, and to get it they will properly announce
themselves and their intentions to allow the host to prepare to
accommodate them.</p>
<p>This capability is a linchpin in removing the process bottleneck
in provisioning new services in the data center. For most
organizations, the network is manually configured. To keep up with
the movement of the provisioning of virtual machines, the network
needs to enable "plug and play".</p>

<h2>Complexity Means Controls</h2>
<p>The network is in a unique postion as a "pipe" as well as a
"control" where it needs to know what communications go where and
plays the role of traffic cop.</p>
<p>This means opening ports between servers, controlling traffic
and setting monitors to make sure traffic is optimized. When things
change, configuration does as well, especially when a new service
is requested. Today, this is controlled by human processes and
controls to keep the network up to date with the applications and
servers that host them.</p>

<p>In the future, there is the opportunity to move forward in
auto-configuration or even smarter handshakes.</p>
<p>In essence, to oversee this process a directory or resources or
inventory would exist that allows the network to "know" what is in
place within it. This is a new control point for the data center,
and is a resource to the network.</p>

<h2>Solutions in Protocols</h2>
<p>802.1.x is technology that has been used in WiFi connections.
One reason it was useful in that context is that it's expected that
the link drops and reconnects frequently and so is seen as an
opportunity for the physical link as well.</p>

<p>The potential upgrades to 802.1 would enable a richer dialog
between the server as it starts up its networking process. This
would allow the server to announce itself and its requirements
(e.g. encryption) and allow the network to respond to these
appropriately (e.g. set encryption key). This process can become a
big win for configuration management where now, the server can come
up in the network and be provisioned according to the policy.</p>

<p>All of this reminds us of the benefits of a company like Apple.
Having the unique opportunity to control the model from end to end
means have the ability to make better tools. We wonder if natural
evolution will get multi-vendor shops a solution for all of their
IT assets.</p>
<p>What will it take to get to a model-driven data center?</p>
