pants&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the only trousers that remind you, and
anyone within eyesight, that you have a penis.</p>
<p>The copy says: "Male makes pure man stuff... like bold and
brawny Barracuda slacks with swing-around pocket styling. They
cling like a girl in the dark. Won't
wrinkle&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;they're permanently pressed! Rarer
fabrics...richer colors...better tailoring...modest prices...all
yours at better stores throughout the Free World. Go look them
over. You'll buy an armload.</p>
<p>H+K CORPORATION, Atlanta, Ga. * creators of MALE - THE FASHION
SPOKESMAN FOR AMERICAN MEN"</p>
<p>I think my favorite part about this retro magazine ad is that
these super manly manly pants are available "at better stores
throughout the Free World." That's as priceless as the placement of
the guy is unfortunate.</p>
