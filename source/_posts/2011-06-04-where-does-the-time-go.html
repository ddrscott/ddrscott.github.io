<p>It's been a while since I've posted anything real. I started on
a couple articles thinking I didn't have time to update Thumb War,
but in the end didn't have time to finish those articles
either.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the simple question. Where does the time go?
My guess is work and family. I found the above image free online,
so I cannot really vouch for it's accuracy, but it sure looks
pretty.</p>
<p>On the Thumb War to-do list is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide Tablet layouts for those who play on Landscape style
devices (Xoom, ASUS Tab, Playbook, HP Slate, etc...)</li>
<li>Update to latest AndEngine to get some critical fixes
orientation issues</li>
<li>Add video of game play to help those who don't "get it".</li>
</ol>
<p>As for the articles that I've started but didn't finish:</p>
<ol>
<li>Closures: Ruby vs Groovy - Fight!</li>
<li>Ghetto Graphs: Too cool for Excel</li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy your summer!</p>
