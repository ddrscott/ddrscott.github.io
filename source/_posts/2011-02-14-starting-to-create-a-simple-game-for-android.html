<p>I've been stewing over a new game concept and have decide to log
ideas, challenges, and progress on here.</p>
<p>The idea is pretty simple: Thumb War for Android</p>
<p>The primary challenges I see of creating this beast will be:</p>
<ol>
<li>game input - multi-touch with ability to track which user is
touching the screen.</li>
<li>game engine - I don't know of any good base game engines out
there that will give me a head start on this project. The few I've
seen are probably too big for me needs.</li>
<li>art work and sound - I'll probably need to get some help on
this one.</li>
<li>time - I'm guessing I'll only have a couple hours a week to
spend, so there's a chance this won't get done till Android is
dead.</li>
</ol>
<p>More to come soon...</p>
