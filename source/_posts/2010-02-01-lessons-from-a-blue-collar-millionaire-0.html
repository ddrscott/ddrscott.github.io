"&lt;strong&gt;New Recipe&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Everyone who had a business told me, "><br>
<p>It's Takeout Tuesday at Nick's Pizza &amp; Pub, and the air is
thick with the smells of hot pizza crust, peppers, onions, and
cheese. Eighteen young men and women -- most of them high school
age -- form an assembly line between a row of worktables and a long
bank of pizza ovens. The kids laugh and shout, even as they focus
intently on their tasks.</p>
<p>Nick Sarillo, 47, stands halfway down the assembly line, holding
a giant wooden pizza board. As the company's founder and CEO, he
doesn't usually work the pizza line anymore. But he is happy to
lend a hand when he can, and the kitchen crew needs all the help it
can get on Tuesdays, thanks to a program Sarillo launched in March
2009 in response to the recession. A sign in the lobby explains the
logic behind the policy:</p>
<p class="c4">Kane County unemployment 6.3% vs. 11.1% Sept. 2008 --
Sept. 2009 &Acirc;&frac12; Price Monday and Takeout Tuesday are
here to stay until the unemployment lines go away.</p>
<p>That is, customers pay half price for pizza in the dining room
on Mondays and half price for carryout on Tuesdays. The effect has
been to turn the two slowest days of the week into the two busiest.
Indeed, the program proved so popular that it initially overwhelmed
the kitchens. "Our promise is to have pizzas ready in 15 minutes
with no mistakes," says Sarillo. "We had so many orders that the
time got up to 25 minutes. Guests were getting upset. It was OK if
I was here to orchestrate, but it got pretty bad if I wasn't."</p>
<p>So what did he do? "I built a system to replace me," Sarillo
says. "I put together a checklist of things that had to be done by
4 p.m., so we could handle the volume. It took about four weeks
until it could work without me. Now we're nailing it."</p>
<p>There are, according to the trade magazine Pizza Today, 70,000
to 75,000 pizza establishments in the United States. Nearly every
town has at least one, and -- except for arguing over which makes
the finest slices -- people seldom pay them much notice, let alone
think of them as a potential source of business and management
wisdom.</p>
<p>And then there's Nick's Pizza &amp; Pub.</p>
<p>Its two restaurants in the northwest suburbs of Chicago have
attracted visitors from far and wide who have heard about Sarillo's
approach to management and the effect it has had on employees. The
numbers tell the tale. In an industry in which annual employee
turnover of 200 percent is considered normal, Sarillo's restaurants
lose and replace just 20 percent of their staff members every year.
Net operating profit in the industry averages 6.6 percent;
Sarillo's runs about 14 percent and has gone as high as 18 percent.
Meanwhile, the 14-year-old company does more volume on a per-unit
basis (an average of $3.5 million over the past three years) than
nearly all independent pizza restaurants. And customers, it seems,
adore the service: On three occasions, waitresses have received
tips of $1,000.</p>
<p>Sarillo grew up around pizza. His father, Nick Sr., owned a
restaurant called Village Pizza in Carpentersville, Illinois, which
he started when his son was in the eighth grade. When Sarillo
opened his first restaurant, in Crystal Lake, in 1995 (the other
opened in nearby Elgin in 2005), he patterned it after his
father's, right down to the pizza recipe. In one key respect,
however, he was determined to make it different. That difference --
and the secret of the company's success -- can be summed up in one
word: culture.</p>
<p>Sarillo has built his company's culture by using a form of
management best characterized as "trust and track." It involves
educating employees about what it takes for the company to be
successful, then trusting them to act accordingly. The alternative
is command and control, wherein success is the boss's
responsibility and employees do what the boss says. Think of the
Navy SEALs versus the National Guard. Both approaches can work, but
they produce very different cultures. If done right, moreover,
trust and track can allow a company to be nimble, flexible, and
productive enough to perform at the highest level through good
economies and bad.</p>
<p>Sarillo is the first to admit that he is an unlikely spokesman
for the benefits of a strong company culture. When he launched
Nick's, he had never heard of company culture. A former
construction worker, he got into the business, he says, because he
had three young children and there was no restaurant in the area at
which families could get together, kids could play, and parents
could relax and have fun. He didn't have a management philosophy --
at least not one he could articulate. He did believe, however, that
he had a choice about how the business would be run. "Everyone I
knew who'd had a business told me, 'No one cares like an owner. No
one works as hard as an owner,' " Sarillo says. "They said, 'Watch
out. People are going to steal.' I set out to prove them wrong. I
wanted a place where everyone worked hard and cared a lot; where
people enjoyed coming to work, felt good afterward, and weren't
motivated to steal. If I couldn't have that kind of business, I
didn't want to have a business."</p>
<p>In the end, he built the kind of business he wanted by
developing a unique management system. Not only is it strikingly
effective, but it's a stark illustration of the notion that good
ideas can spring from the most humble of sources. If you look
closely, you can identify 10 key ingredients of Sarillo's recipe
for building a company culture that delivers.</p>
1. Feel your community's pain; share its joy
<p>Half-Price Mondays and Takeout Tuesdays are symbols of Nick's
ongoing commitment to the communities in which it operates. So was
a decision in August 2008 to surprise the guests one Thursday
evening by picking up the check, in recognition of the tough times
many were facing. "It cost us $20,000," says Sarillo's partner,
Christopher Adams, "but it created tremendous buzz."</p>
<p>It also reinforced the company's reputation as a community
bulwark -- a reputation it has been assiduously building since Day
One. The restaurants host fundraisers almost every week, with the
company contributing 15 percent of the gross profit generated by
the event. In addition, Nick's sponsors two or three large benefits
a year, many of them for families facing high medical bills because
of a health crisis. For the benefits, the company donates 100
percent of its gross profit for the day, and servers often kick in
their tips. "I have never known them to turn away anyone with a
legitimate charitable purpose," says Crystal Lake Mayor Aaron
Shepley.</p>
<p>All of this has an ancillary benefit for the business. "It
reminds our team members how incredibly different we are from any
other place they know," says Adams.</p>
2. Hire only A+ players
<p>Forty-one percent of the company's 182 employees are ages 16 to
18, almost all of them still in high school. The others include a
large number of mothers, college students, and people whose main
job is somewhere else. Such employees do not typically make for a
stable work force. Yet people who work at Nick's seem to find the
culture irresistible. "When I come here, I really don't feel like
I'm coming to work," says server Aubrey Judson, 25. "My boyfriend
doesn't understand it. I just like to be here." She works only on
weekends, she adds, as she has a full-time job at an online
advertising agency during the week.</p>
<p>Her job as a server was very likely the more difficult of the
two to land. Just one of every 12 applicants to Nick's gets hired.
"I was really surprised by the process," she says. "You get
interviewed twice, and you take a personality test."</p>
<p>The explicit goal of the process is to hire only the best of the
best -- A+ players, in the language of the company. People who
inquire about a job receive a handout detailing the company's
purpose and values. They are advised not to waste their time
applying unless, after perusing the sheet, they think Nick's sounds
like a place they would like to work. If they decide to move
forward, they first have a talk with a manager. Nearly all of them
are then invited to an interview. Twenty percent of those are
invited to a second interview. Two managers are in each interview,
and one sits in on both. In other words, candidates need four yes
votes from three managers to receive an offer. Those who aren't
selected get a thank-you note and a voucher for a free pizza.</p>
<p>Along the way, the applicants are scrutinized and tested. There
is a lot of role playing, not to mention the occasional
off-the-wall question. "They asked me, 'What are you doing to
improve yourself physically, mentally, or spiritually?' " says
Scott Jewitt, who had been a manager at Bennigan's, Lone Star
Steakhouse, Boston Market, Panera Bread, and CiCi's Pizza before
joining Nick's in the fall of 2008 and now is an operating partner.
"I was speechless for a moment. It was so different from any
interview experience I'd been through. And I'm not an amateur."
Ninety-six percent of those hired stay at least a year.</p>
3. Learn, grow, compensate
<p>Getting hired at Nick's is a ticket -- not just to a job, but to
the company's training program, which is elaborate, rigorous, and
ongoing. It begins with a two-day orientation, which includes more
role playing and discussion of the company's purpose, values, and
culture. That's followed by 101, a four-hour stint in the kitchen,
where everybody goes through a basic pizza-making course. The new
hires then separate into work groups and move on to 201, in which
they are trained and certified in specific jobs. A pizza maker, for
example, may take two to four weeks to reach the level of
proficiency required for certification, after which she can make
pizzas on her own. When she gets certified in two other jobs --
say, salads and sandwiches -- her wage goes from $8.25 to $9 per
hour. After certification in six positions, it increases to $9.50
an hour, and she gets a red hat. (Up to then, she has been wearing
a tan hat.) Certification in nine positions earns her a black hat
and a raise to $11 an hour.</p>
<p>It's her choice, however, whether she goes for any
certifications beyond 201. She can stay at one certification as
long as she likes. Then again, she might want to go on to 301 and
become a trainer, which offers a variety of benefits, including
eligibility for profit sharing and preference in scheduling. To
qualify, she must achieve mastery in her certifications -- that is,
a top rating on a one-to-five scale -- and read the book Mastery:
The Keys to Success and Long-Term Fulfillment, by George Leonard.
She then takes a three-day course on communication and leadership.
At the end of the course, she receives a Leadership 301 Passport
with a checklist of 30 specific behaviors she is required to model
or recognize someone else modeling. She has five weeks to complete
the passport, which involves observing and describing two such
incidents for each behavior and getting a member of the leadership
team to sign off on it. Finally, she takes a train-the-trainer
course. On completion, she becomes a trainer.</p>
4. Systems are for building trust
<p>This is not the sort of training curriculum you expect to find
in a company doing just over $7 million a year in sales. Then
again, the same could be said about all of Nick's systems -- from
hiring to inventory management to the handling of workplace
conflict. Pretty much everything that happens in the business has
been thought through, defined, and taught, right down to the best
method for greeting a customer.</p>
<p>Take the process of opening and closing the kitchen. In a
typical restaurant, a supervisor is responsible for both, has a
long checklist of things to be done, and tells everyone what to do.
At Nick's, by contrast, the whole kitchen crew is responsible. To
help people keep track of what needs to happen, there is a
laminated "ops card" for each task involved. Each ops card is red
at the top and green at the bottom and has its own slot in a
converted timecard holder. In the morning, when staff members come
in, the ops cards are in the slots with the red end showing.
Whenever a task is completed, someone turns over the corresponding
ops card so the green end is showing. By closing time, all the
cards are showing green. It's then the manager's job to make sure
they are all red again before people arrive the next morning.</p>
<p>The system is an important mechanism for creating a
trust-and-track culture and for breaking the habits of command and
control. "Managers trained in command and control think it's their
responsibility to tell people what to do," Sarillo says. "They like
having that power. It gives them their sense of self-worth. But
when you manage that way, people see it, and they start waiting for
you to tell them what to do. You wind up with too much on your
plate, and things fall through the cracks. It's not efficient or
effective. We want all the team members to feel responsible for the
company's success."</p>
<p>Some people would no doubt find such a regime unbearable, but
Nick's employees appear to thrive under it, especially the high
school students. "Parents tell me, 'I don't know what you did to my
kid, but whatever it is, keep doing it,' " says Sarillo.</p>
<p>What Sarillo has done, on one level, is simply to treat high
school students -- and everyone else -- like intelligent,
responsible, and, above all, trustworthy human beings. "All of our
systems are geared toward creating a culture of trust," says
Sarillo. "A lot of people would say trust is intangible. We've made
it tangible by putting these systems in. They allow you to see
whether the trust is there and whether the way people behave is
promoting or undermining trust."</p>
5. Coach in the moment, not after the fact
<p>To be sure, just about every company has systems of one sort or
another. A common one is the annual performance review, which
almost all management experts would say is essential for giving
employees the feedback they need. But Sarillo doesn't believe in
performance reviews. Rather, managers and employees are trained to
coach in the moment, providing feedback immediately.</p>
<p>There are actually three forms of feedback at Nick's. The first
is called a feedback loop and applies mainly to new employees. At
the end of a shift, a trainer will ask, "What is one thing you did
well, and -- if you could replay the tape -- what is one thing you
would do to enhance your performance?" It's a two-way conversation,
hence a loop.</p>
<p>The second form is called performance feedback and, again,
usually comes at the end of a shift. After observing someone's
performance, the manager or trainer will mention one thing the
person did well and one thing he or she should try to improve.</p>
<p>The third form is direct feedback and happens in the moment.
Suppose, for example, that Sarillo observes a host with her head
down as a guest walks by. "With a smile on my face and in a nice
way, I'd say, 'Eyes up, Rhonda. Remember, five steps with every
guest.' " He is referring to another mechanism: Smile and greet a
customer whenever you come within five steps of one.</p>
<p>As for deciding when to provide feedback, managers are taught
that everything is an interview. "We do a lot of role playing in
our job interviews," Sarillo says. "When you observe a behavior,
the question is, Would you have hired that behavior? If yes, you
can recognize it. If no, you can coach it. But either way, you
should do it in the moment."</p>
6. A consultant can be more helpful than you think
<p>Sarillo says he first got the urge to expand to new locations in
2002, but he wasn't confident in his ability to do it without
outside help. So he brought in an accountant and then a couple of
consultants. "They all talked about control, control, control,"
Sarillo says. "I felt like I was on Mars. What I was doing was
obviously working, but I didn't know anyone else who ran a business
this way. I mean, I'm an ordinary guy. If I can do it, anybody
can." Then he met a consultant named Rudy Miick. "He asked all the
right questions," says Sarillo.</p>
<p>He decided to hire Miick, who didn't come cheap. Sarillo
estimates that, in 2003 and 2004, he spent $200,000 preparing to
expand, 80 percent of which went to pay for Miick's services.
That's a lot of money for a business doing just over $3 million a
year in sales. But Miick played a key role in helping the
restaurants streamline their management systems, which helped
reduce employee turnover from 185 percent to 20 percent. Given a
cost of $1,500 to recruit, interview, and train a new employee, the
drop in turnover alone saved almost $250,000 a year.</p>
7. Turn negatives into positives by making talk safe
<p>Sarillo uses a system called safe space, which allows employees
and managers to have difficult conversations by following certain
well-defined rules. One rule, for example, is that statements must
be based on data, not feelings or speculation. Another rule is to
identify "the moose in the room" -- that is, something many people
are aware of but no one is talking about -- the goal being to nip
gossip and rumors in the bud. Adams, for one, feels that safe space
is "the most important way we create trust in the
organization."</p>
<p>One team member recently used safe space to question Sarillo
about a sarcastic remark he had made. Sarillo had intended it to be
good-natured joshing, but it came across as pointed criticism. "I
said, 'Holy cow! I didn't realize it,' and I apologized," Sarillo
says. "It reminded me that sarcasm can be lethal when you're the
boss. I have my share of imperfections, and I love it when team
members call me out on them. It's not a threat if you have a
culture based on trust. In fact, it proves that the trust is
there."</p>
8. "Why" is more important than "what" or "how"
<p>Sarillo likes to say he doesn't tell people what to do. Instead,
he prefers to explain the situation and let them choose. Of course,
giving people choices rather than orders requires trusting them to
do the right thing. But it works the other way as well: They have
to trust you enough to believe your explanation of the situation.
That means making sure they understand why they are being asked to
do whatever it is you want them to do.</p>
<p>Explaining the "why" is particularly important, Sarillo says,
for young employees. "Today's teens are as strong and as good as
any previous generation of workers, but you need to share the 'why'
with them. The days of 'do what I tell you' are gone. You simply
won't be successful."</p>
<p>That can present a challenge for managers accustomed to giving
orders, as Sarillo discovered the hard way. In 2005, he and Adams
set a goal of having five restaurants by the end of 2010. To
achieve it, they realized they would need experienced general
managers to run the restaurants they had. The three people they
wound up hiring came out of established restaurant chains. On the
surface, the managers embraced the company's purpose and values, as
well as the systems that support them. Eventually, however, Sarillo
decided he had to let all of them go. One tip-off was their
inability to control costs.</p>
<p>As usual, the devil was in the details. Each Nick's Pizza &amp;
Pub has a just-in-time purchasing system, whereby food and beverage
usage is tracked daily and orders are placed two or three times a
week. A physical inventory is done once a week and then matched
against the prior week's count, minus usage, plus purchases, to
make sure the costs are under control. The goal is to keep beverage
costs at about 22 percent of revenue and food costs at 20
percent.</p>
<p>But week after week, the costs ran too high, and physical
inventory counts didn't jibe with usage and purchases. When Sarillo
finally investigated the problem, he traced it to the managers'
inability to let go of their old habits. "Their idea of leadership
was telling people what to do," he says. "They had someone else put
in the numbers, and when the numbers came out wrong, they didn't
dig deeper to discover why. Because they didn't know the 'why,'
they couldn't share it with the team members. When you know the
'why,' it's really easy to figure out what to do, but sharing that
kind of information wasn't how they'd been trained to manage."</p>
<p>In the end, Sarillo turned over the responsibility for tracking
costs at the Elgin restaurant to a 24-year-old woman named Jenny
Petersen, who had begun working at Nick's when she was 16. She
solved the problems in four weeks. She could do it, she says,
because she cared about the 'why.' "I think it's a matter of
personal drive and ambition," Petersen says. "You need the drive to
ask questions and do the research. If our inventory numbers are
off, there's got to be a reason. I like finding out what it
is."</p>
9. "Trust" without "track" is an invitation to trouble
<p>In retrospect, Sarillo acknowledges that hiring those managers
was one of his biggest mistakes in recent years. It became a big
mistake, however, because he wasn't paying attention. For two
years, he was totally focused on laying the groundwork for a new
Nick's in Chicago, which was supposed to open in mid-2008. Only
after that plan fell through did he turn his attention back to the
existing restaurants. The company was in serious trouble, mainly
because he had invested so much time, energy, and money -- about
$300,000 -- in the Chicago project, but also because of slumping
sales and out-of-control costs at Elgin and Crystal Lake.</p>
<p>From a distance, he attributed the problems to economic factors
over which the company had no control. But as he looked more
closely, he realized there was more to it. The cost-control issues
were symptomatic of something deeper. The general managers weren't
supporting the systems, and so the company's culture was beginning
to change.</p>
<p>And yet Sarillo had to admit that the problems were ultimately
his responsibility. Looking back, he says, "The big lesson is
accountability. Results are results. You have to be real about how
people are doing. I wasn't holding those managers accountable for
their results and their behavior because I wasn't keeping close
enough track of what they were doing."</p>
10. Beware of growing before you -- and the company -- are ready
<p>Sarillo didn't keep track in part because he was mesmerized by
growth. He had decided to expand into Chicago, in the belief that a
Nick's there would provide visibility the company could never get
in Crystal Lake and Elgin.</p>
<p>He was eventually forced to cancel the Chicago project, however,
when he lost his bank financing in mid-2008. The turn of events
appeared at first to be a disaster for the company. It turned out,
however, to be a blessing. "Because we were not able to do Chicago,
we wound up doing something more important: fixing the culture in
Elgin and Crystal Lake," says Sarillo. "If we'd opened in Chicago,
I wouldn't have had so many financial problems, but I would have
had much, much bigger cultural problems. By the time I found out
about them, it might have been too late."</p>
<p>In the process, he learned an important lesson about the type of
management he will need in the future. "I've decided there are two
ways to get the right person to run one of our restaurants," he
says. "One, you can get a new manager like Jenny Petersen, who
hasn't already developed bad habits somewhere else. Or, two, you
can get a manager with experience in the industry who's completely
fed up with the corporate way of doing things and thinking, I
really need a change." That's the story with Scott Jewitt, the
operating partner at Crystal Lake.</p>
<p>So is Sarillo still committed to opening other Nick's Pizza
&amp; Pubs? "Oh, yes, I feel more inspired to grow than ever," he
says. "People really do want to have a meaningful place to work,
and that is one thing I know how to do well. So how could I not
want to keep doing it for more and more people? I mean, what could
be a more fulfilling life?"</p>
