I've decided to use AndEngine to do the first version of the game.
It<br>
has a ton of example source, and seems to be easy enough to use.
I<br>
guess I should have looked harder before doing the previous post.
I've also talked with several colleagues and they validated the<br>
general game mechanics. As for the rest of my evening, I will
attempt to get AndEngine up and<br>
running and maybe get an animated sprite drawn before the nights
out.<br>
Woot!
