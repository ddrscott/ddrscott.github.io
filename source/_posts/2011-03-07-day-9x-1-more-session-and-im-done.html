<p>I believe I'm almost finished with some thing that I wouldn't
hate being in the market. I know that standard seems a bit low, but
if I don't release this thing soon it won't ever get released.</p>
<p>The past sessions were all about artwork. This could have been a
long rabbit trail, but my wife reminded me to get this thing done.
And that every minute I send on this creation, I lose with my son.
Anyway, artwork is basically done. I have to crop here and there.
But I think it's workable.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Here's some things that are completed:</p>
<ol>
<li>game play of 2.5 mini games (2 full game, and a variation of
one of them)&nbsp;</li>
<li>working menus, even replaying a game</li>
<li>sound feed back for points in 1.5 of the games</li>
<li>theme and art work - most from&nbsp;<a href=
"http://www.lostgarden.com/search/label/free%20game%20graphics">http://www.lostgarden.com/search/label/free%20game%20graphics</a>
who has an amazingly flexible license which I couldn't release this
thing without.</li>
<li>winning scenes and anxiety inducing count down when game is
about to end.</li>
</ol>
<p>Stuff yet to do before release:</p>
<ol>
<li>add credits scene to fulfill free licensing.</li>
<li>add sound to game 1</li>
<li>make replay more obvious on winning scene.</li>
</ol>
<p>Stuff to finish after release:</p>
<ol>
<li>More games</li>
<li>More sound effects</li>
<li>refactor code base so game 3 is easier</li>
<li>respond to user feed back</li>
<li>(never ending list)</li>
</ol>
<p>After release I'll post images of the game...</p>
