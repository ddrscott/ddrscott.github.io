<p>I've been a bit lax on updates due to spending any free time on
the game mechanics.</p>
<p>The overhead physics is now about right with some polish needed
around transfer of momentum from the touch event to a game object.
AndEngine, or really any game engine, doesn't make touching and
physics work well together. If you want to make an Angry Birds
clone that would be easy, but making your finger the bird is much
harder... unless it's that other bird...</p>
<p>Anyway, I finally have the first mini-game completed. It is
called Keep Away, with the simple concept of keeping stuff away
from the opponent. There are basic menus, dialogs, game time, and
game over transitions. I can now play test with my wife, who thinks
the best part is the clucking noise when things collide. Hopefully
that won't be the the only highlight.</p>
<p>I would post a screenshot but it's still a bit too ugly for the
Internet.</p>
