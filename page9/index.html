<p>Today, Twitter moved into a new, much larger office in San
Francisco. The space, which was previously
Bebo&acirc;&euro;&trade;s SF office, is right around the corner
from their old one.</p>


<p>A few members of the Twitter team spent much of the weekend
decorating the new digs with a number of Twitter-themed elements
like birds and @ symbols. Check out some of the pictures being
posted to the web by Twitter employees below. And yes, there is a
DJ booth &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and <a href=
