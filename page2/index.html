<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve posted anything real. I started on
a couple articles thinking I didn&#8217;t have time to update Thumb War,
but in the end didn&#8217;t have time to finish those articles
either.</p>


<p>Which brings me to the simple question. Where does the time go?
My guess is work and family. I found the above image free online,
so I cannot really vouch for it&#8217;s accuracy, but it sure looks
pretty.</p>


<p>On the Thumb War to-do list is:</p>


<ol>
<li>Provide Tablet layouts for those who play on Landscape style
devices (Xoom, ASUS Tab, Playbook, HP Slate, etc&#8230;)</li>
<li>Update to latest AndEngine to get some critical fixes
orientation issues</li>
<li>Add video of game play to help those who don&#8217;t &#8220;get it&#8221;.</li>
</ol>


<p>As for the articles that I&#8217;ve started but didn&#8217;t finish:</p>


<ol>
<li>Closures: Ruby vs Groovy - Fight!</li>
<li>Ghetto Graphs: Too cool for Excel</li>
</ol>


<p>Enjoy your summer!</p>

"http://bellard.org/jslinux/tech.html">Fabrice Bellard built an x86
PC emulator</a> using JavaScript. He&#8217;s even gone so far as to
install Linux kernel 2.6.20 on top of it. &#8220;The code is written in
pure Javascript using Typed Arrays which are available in recent
browsers,&#8221; Bellard wrote. It works in Firefox and Chrome 11, but
not not Chrome 12.</p>
<p>As for the Linux instance, Bellard wrote: &#8220;The disk image is
just a ram disk image loaded at boot time. It contains a filesystem
generated with <a href="http://buildroot.uclibc.org/">Buildroot</a>
containing <a href="http://www.busybox.net/">BusyBox</a>. I added
my toy C compiler <a href="http://bellard.org/tcc">TinyCC</a> and
my unfinished but usable emacs clone <a href=
"http://bellard.org/qemacs">QEmacs</a>.&#8221; You can see Linux running

<p>Bellard did it just for fun, but he speculates that it could be
useful for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benchmarking of Javascript engines (how much time takes your
Javascript engine to boot Linux ?). For this particular
application, efficient handling of 32 bit signed and unsigned
integers and of typed arrays is important.</li>
<li>Client side processing using an x86 library, for example for
cryptographic purposes. For such application, the x86 emulator can
be modified to provide an API to load x86 dynamic libraries and to
provide a js-ctypes like API to call the C/C++ functions from
javascript.</li>
<li>A more advanced version would allow to use old DOS PC software
such as games.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oddly enough, he found that Linux ran twice as fast on Jaeger
Monkey as it did on V8. He&#8217;s not sure why.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2011/how-to-make-a-lite-version-of-an-android-game/">How to make a lite version of an Android game</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I&#8217;ve discovered that no amount of screenshots or marketing speak
will ever get someone past the $1.99 price point. So with a bit of
research and rework a free version Thumb War is now
available&nbsp;<a href=
"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.thethumbwar.lite"><span class="s1">here</span></a>.</p>


<p class="p1">For a while I thought the process of making 1 project
into 2 was going to break the time bank, but after running
into&nbsp;<a href=
"http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-eclipse.html"><span class="s1">this</span></a>&nbsp;article
on the Android Developer site the pieces fit together quite
nicely.</p>


<p class="p1">The secret is in one property setting of an Eclipse
project which allows a project to be shared by another. The setting
is &#8220;Is Library&#8221;. Once enabled all classes and resources (drawable,
layouts, strings, etc) are available to users of the library. The
activities can be addressed in the manifest with absolute package
names instead of the relative package names.</p>


<p><img src=
"http://developer.android.com/images/developing/adt-props-isLib.png"
alt=""></p>


<p>The best part of the whole thing is I don&#8217;t need to create a
separate jar build process to make it all work. Now, if you&#8217;re the
type that likes everything automated, I&#8217;m leaving that as an
exercise to the reader.</p>


<p class="p2">After changing the original project a library, I did
the following to get the paid version working again.</p>


<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1">create new Android project in Eclipse with the same
package name as my library.</li>
<li class="li1">edit Android properties and added a reference to
the newly converted library project.</li>
<li class="li1">copied the Android Manifest from the library
project into the paid project.</li>
<li class="li1">changed the activity packages in the paid manifest
to use the full absolute package names.</li>
<li class="li1">removed all drawable in paid project</li>
<li class="li1">removed hello world in string.xml and updated
app_name</li>
<li class="li1">set svn:externals to the library project&#8217;s assets
directory into the paid projects assets directory, then svn
update</li>
<li class="li1">run</li>
</ol>


<p class="p2">Surprisingly everything just worked.</p>


<p class="p1">The next step was to actually create the free
project. This is pretty much the same as the paid project so I
started with the paid project as the base.</p>


<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1">copy paid project and rename to lite</li>
<li class="li1">change package name to com.thethumbwar.lite</li>
<li class="li1">run</li>
</ol>


<p class="p1">This also worked. It was functionally the same as the
paid project and the original pre-library-itized project and both
were on my device at the same time. Which means it meets Androids
unique package restrictions, too.</p>


<p class="p1">The final step in the free project was to add a few
restrictions to it and add a few dialogs to encourage the players
to purchase the paid version. That fortunately was the trivial
work, phew! In case you&#8217;re curious, I&#8217;ve restricted 3 of the 5
games and if a user selects a restricted game from the menu a
dialog will tell them that it&#8217;s unavailable in the lite and
provides a button to go to the Android Market to purchase the full
version.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2011/IpgnnyyqiA/">Sumo mini-game notes</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I&#8217;ve created a working version of the sumo and it is revealing some
overall bugs for the game engine at large.<br>
First the precision of two touch points greatly decreases when they
are close together I presume this is an issue with capacitive
screens and not a software issue. This issue hasn&#8217;t shown itself
till now since the other games are faster paced and acurracy is
less important.<br>
Second issue is motion jitters. This occurs when hold a target
object in place. One would expect the item to never move, but thats
not what happens. After a few seconds the held piece will violently
spring around the touch point. This happens due to how the touch
sensor provides me the information. I get touch events in 3 main
categories: down, move, and up. (I&#8217;m specifically ignoring cancel
for now.) On down I add a heavy mass to the touched object. This
makes it practically immobile from impacts by other objects. When I
get a move event I add linear velocity to the object so it can
shift to the touched coordinate. If the finger is down and but
never moves, I don&#8217;t get any other events from the sensor which
tell me that it&#8217;s still down. I need to rely on an up event to
negate the down. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t always get the up event or
even the cancel &#8230;&#8230;.</p>

  <p>
    <p>Just updated to the trunk build of AndEngine which broke almost
every line of code I had. There were a bunch of renamings that
occurred to replace the concept of scene layers with a more generic
child entity structure. The shape modifiers also got moved to
another package to differentiate from particle modifiers.<br>
All in all, the transition was smooth and I will now be able to
contribute to code back into the main source tree without as many
conflicts.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2011/finger-mechanics-help/">Finger Mechanics. Help!</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I am finding it near impossible to get a perfect simulation of
finger to table top physics. I&#8217;m not sure if this is a hardware
limitation or just my bad algorithm. In a previous post I had a
workable solution by dragging pieces around instead of teleporting,
and that does work enough. But now that the game is released I feel
the need to make is better.<br>
The issue with dragging is the delay that is percieved when moving
the object around very quickly. It looks like the object is chasing
your finger which breaks the illusion. Fortunately, none of the
mini-games use swirling but it bugs me in the Free Play mode.<br>
In the real world, we can put two coins on a table and push one
coins into the other. On a touch screen the coordinates come in
after the push which is already too late for a perfect sim. So I
think some predictive algorithm is in need.<br>
If I can take a previous position and the current I should be able
to predict the next and push the object there directly. Sadly, this
type of math is my worst suit and I don&#8217;t have the time to figure
it out. If anyone out there lives and breathes math, feel free to
comment with a solution. Otherwise the whole word will have to play
with drag physics or play a different game. Sad.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2011/day-9x-1-more-session-and-im-done/">Day 9+X, 1 More Session and I&#8217;m done!</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I believe I&#8217;m almost finished with some thing that I wouldn&#8217;t
hate being in the market. I know that standard seems a bit low, but
if I don&#8217;t release this thing soon it won&#8217;t ever get released.</p>


<p>The past sessions were all about artwork. This could have been a
long rabbit trail, but my wife reminded me to get this thing done.
And that every minute I send on this creation, I lose with my son.
Anyway, artwork is basically done. I have to crop here and there.
But I think it&#8217;s workable.</p>


<p>Here&#8217;s some things that are completed:</p>


<ol>
<li>game play of 2.5 mini games (2 full game, and a variation of
one of them)&nbsp;</li>
<li>working menus, even replaying a game</li>
<li>sound feed back for points in 1.5 of the games</li>
<li>theme and art work - most from&nbsp;<a href=
"http://www.lostgarden.com/search/label/free%20game%20graphics">http://www.lostgarden.com/search/label/free%20game%20graphics</a>
who has an amazingly flexible license which I couldn&#8217;t release this
thing without.</li>
<li>winning scenes and anxiety inducing count down when game is
about to end.</li>
</ol>


<p>Stuff yet to do before release:</p>


<ol>
<li>add credits scene to fulfill free licensing.</li>
<li>add sound to game 1</li>
<li>make replay more obvious on winning scene.</li>
</ol>


<p>Stuff to finish after release:</p>


<ol>
<li>More games</li>
<li>More sound effects</li>
<li>refactor code base so game 3 is easier</li>
<li>respond to user feed back</li>
<li>(never ending list)</li>
</ol>


<p>After release I&#8217;ll post images of the game&#8230;</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2011/day-9-counters-and-player-positions/">Day 9 - Counters and Player Positions</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Due to popular demand I added visual count down indicators. The
feature shows the second remaining on the screen then it explodes
away like a puff if smoke. This will be done by a nice little shape
modifier feature built into AndEngine. I want to apply 3 modifiers
in&nbsp;parallel:&nbsp;change alpha from 1 to 0 (visible to
invisible), scale 1 to 10 (normal to huge), and rotate 0 to 360.
This was easier said than done, because of a difference between
regular shapes and text. Regular shapes use alpha blending by
default, text <strong>doesn&#8217;t</strong>. Unfortunately, my first
suspect was the animation library, instead of blending. After an
hour troubleshooting I found out setAlpha on text wasn&#8217;t working
without any animation. This lead to googling &#8220;+AndEngine text
setAlpha&#8221;. The first hit saves the day with a one liner that sets
the blending mode of the
shape:<code>setBlendFunction(GL10.GL_SRC_ALPHA,
GL10.GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)</code></p>


<p>Why this isn&#8217;t the default like the other shapes is a mystery to
me.</p>


<p>As for the player positions, I learned how bad my geometry is
again. In four player mode there should be a &#8220;Ready?&#8221; touch area
for each player in each corner of the screen. The text should be
oriented so each player can view the text in the correct
perspective. This should be as simple as rotating the text in the
correct 45 degree increment. Sadly, it took me a shameful full hour
to figure out what those were. I&#8217;m sure if I stayed awake in that
class for the same hour I would have learned more than 4
numbers.&nbsp;AndEngine rotates clockwise so&nbsp;starting in the
upper right corner the rotational angles I &#8220;discovered&#8221; are: 135,
225, 45, and 315.</p>

<p>I wish I could make this posting more exciting, but game
logistics will <em class="c1">always</em>&nbsp;be lame.</p>
