<p>Tricked by YouTube again. This video series really teaches
something instead of just saying how easy it is to learn. I like
how this instructor needs to reference the sheet music later in the
series. He is human after all.</p>


<p>Hopefully one day I&#8217;ll be good enough to actually apply these
principles and it would make a real difference to my technique.
Until then it&#8217;s back to reading sheet music for me.</p>

and Chrome projects are banking on it, and most web developers are
ecstatic about what it means. It&#8217;s HTML5, and if you&#8217;re not exactly
sure what it is, here&#8217;s an explainer.</p>

do-it-yourself website space is so crowded right now that it&#8217;s
amazing to see anyone launch a product and cut through the noise.
Still, we were captivated by the simplicity and design of <a href=

  "http://card.ly">Card.ly</a>, instead of forcing you to use
Facebook, LinkedIn or your neglected blog to represent you, Flavors
lets you to build a basic vanity site in less than 10 minutes. As
of this evening non-designers will have a chance to revel in their
newly found web sex appeal.</p>
