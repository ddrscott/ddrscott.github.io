<p>After nearly a year without Posterous, I&rsquo;ve finally got around to migrating to another system.
This time around it&rsquo;s a static blog builder: <a href="http://octopress.org/">http://octopress.org/</a></p>

  <p>
    <p>I&#8217;m sick of small &#8220;sexy&#8221; devices. I want a full screen every
where I go. So I want some one to make this for us, and get a big
celebrity to sport it and make it cool. I know I can&#8217;t pull it off
alone.</p>


<p>I&#8217;m hoping the future Galaxy Note/Tab 3.0 can be hugged by
Backpocket 2.0&#8217;s embrace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For those in the embedded Linux world, Busybox seems to be the
single most important thing to have in their filesystem other than
OS itself. This is something I just recently discovered as I
started rooting my Android devices. Prior to Busybox I&rsquo;ve
been stuck using my laptop to edit files, then using
<code>adb</code> commands to get things to the right location on
the device. When I was really stuck, I&rsquo;d end up using
<code>adb shell</code> and the simplified utilities that are in
<code>/system/bin</code>. But now with Busybox I have access to all
the commands I&rsquo;m accustom to using in a full Linux/Unix
distribution.</p>

    <p>The jury is still out on whether I can productively write
anything on a mobile device. I just received a Galaxy Note,
installed Hackers Keyboard, and installed Writer app. The Note
provides nearly an extra inch of keyboard while the Hackers
Keyboard provides all the typical keys on used to on a desktop.
Lastly was finding an app that highlights my favorite plain text
writing language, Markdown.</p>

    <p>This issue came up in my day job where the client didn&rsquo;t
like our password reset passwords. They said it was too random and
people can&rsquo;t remember it long enough between reading it in

    <p>I just found out about this story this morning, and it warmed up
my day.</p>


<p>It supports my belief that we&#8217;re all born with the yearning to
create stuff.Cheers to the supportive father that didn&#8217;t minimize
his efforts or force him to do what others expect of him.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve posted anything real. I started on
a couple articles thinking I didn&#8217;t have time to update Thumb War,
but in the end didn&#8217;t have time to finish those articles
either.</p>


<p>Which brings me to the simple question. Where does the time go?
My guess is work and family. I found the above image free online,
so I cannot really vouch for it&#8217;s accuracy, but it sure looks
pretty.</p>


<p>On the Thumb War to-do list is:</p>


<ol>
<li>Provide Tablet layouts for those who play on Landscape style
devices (Xoom, ASUS Tab, Playbook, HP Slate, etc&#8230;)</li>
<li>Update to latest AndEngine to get some critical fixes
orientation issues</li>
<li>Add video of game play to help those who don&#8217;t &#8220;get it&#8221;.</li>
</ol>


<p>As for the articles that I&#8217;ve started but didn&#8217;t finish:</p>


<ol>
<li>Closures: Ruby vs Groovy - Fight!</li>
<li>Ghetto Graphs: Too cool for Excel</li>
</ol>


<p>Enjoy your summer!</p>

"http://bellard.org/jslinux/tech.html">Fabrice Bellard built an x86
PC emulator</a> using JavaScript. He&#8217;s even gone so far as to
install Linux kernel 2.6.20 on top of it. &#8220;The code is written in
pure Javascript using Typed Arrays which are available in recent
browsers,&#8221; Bellard wrote. It works in Firefox and Chrome 11, but
not not Chrome 12.</p>
<p>As for the Linux instance, Bellard wrote: &#8220;The disk image is
just a ram disk image loaded at boot time. It contains a filesystem
generated with <a href="http://buildroot.uclibc.org/">Buildroot</a>
containing <a href="http://www.busybox.net/">BusyBox</a>. I added
my toy C compiler <a href="http://bellard.org/tcc">TinyCC</a> and
my unfinished but usable emacs clone <a href=
"http://bellard.org/qemacs">QEmacs</a>.&#8221; You can see Linux running
JavaScript <a href="http://bellard.org/jslinux/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Bellard did it just for fun, but he speculates that it could be
useful for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benchmarking of Javascript engines (how much time takes your
Javascript engine to boot Linux ?). For this particular
application, efficient handling of 32 bit signed and unsigned
integers and of typed arrays is important.</li>
<li>Client side processing using an x86 library, for example for
cryptographic purposes. For such application, the x86 emulator can
be modified to provide an API to load x86 dynamic libraries and to
provide a js-ctypes like API to call the C/C++ functions from
javascript.</li>
<li>A more advanced version would allow to use old DOS PC software
such as games.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oddly enough, he found that Linux ran twice as fast on Jaeger
Monkey as it did on V8. He&#8217;s not sure why.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2011/how-to-make-a-lite-version-of-an-android-game/">How to make a lite version of an Android game</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I&#8217;ve discovered that no amount of screenshots or marketing speak
will ever get someone past the $1.99 price point. So with a bit of
research and rework a free version Thumb War is now
available&nbsp;<a href=
"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.thethumbwar.lite"><span class="s1">here</span></a>.</p>


<p class="p1">For a while I thought the process of making 1 project
into 2 was going to break the time bank, but after running
into&nbsp;<a href=
"http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-eclipse.html"><span class="s1">this</span></a>&nbsp;article
on the Android Developer site the pieces fit together quite
nicely.</p>


<p class="p1">The secret is in one property setting of an Eclipse
project which allows a project to be shared by another. The setting
is &#8220;Is Library&#8221;. Once enabled all classes and resources (drawable,
layouts, strings, etc) are available to users of the library. The
activities can be addressed in the manifest with absolute package
names instead of the relative package names.</p>


<p><img src=
"http://developer.android.com/images/developing/adt-props-isLib.png"
alt=""></p>


<p>The best part of the whole thing is I don&#8217;t need to create a
separate jar build process to make it all work. Now, if you&#8217;re the
type that likes everything automated, I&#8217;m leaving that as an
exercise to the reader.</p>


<p class="p2">After changing the original project a library, I did
the following to get the paid version working again.</p>


<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1">create new Android project in Eclipse with the same
package name as my library.</li>
<li class="li1">edit Android properties and added a reference to
the newly converted library project.</li>
<li class="li1">copied the Android Manifest from the library
project into the paid project.</li>
<li class="li1">changed the activity packages in the paid manifest
to use the full absolute package names.</li>
<li class="li1">removed all drawable in paid project</li>
<li class="li1">removed hello world in string.xml and updated
app_name</li>
<li class="li1">set svn:externals to the library project&#8217;s assets
directory into the paid projects assets directory, then svn
update</li>
<li class="li1">run</li>
</ol>


<p class="p2">Surprisingly everything just worked.</p>


<p class="p1">The next step was to actually create the free
project. This is pretty much the same as the paid project so I
started with the paid project as the base.</p>


<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1">copy paid project and rename to lite</li>
<li class="li1">change package name to com.thethumbwar.lite</li>
<li class="li1">run</li>
</ol>


<p class="p1">This also worked. It was functionally the same as the
paid project and the original pre-library-itized project and both
were on my device at the same time. Which means it meets Androids
unique package restrictions, too.</p>


<p class="p1">The final step in the free project was to add a few
restrictions to it and add a few dialogs to encourage the players
to purchase the paid version. That fortunately was the trivial
work, phew! In case you&#8217;re curious, I&#8217;ve restricted 3 of the 5
games and if a user selects a restricted game from the menu a
dialog will tell them that it&#8217;s unavailable in the lite and
provides a button to go to the Android Market to purchase the full
version.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2011/IpgnnyyqiA/">Sumo mini-game notes</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I&#8217;ve created a working version of the sumo and it is revealing some
overall bugs for the game engine at large.<br>
First the precision of two touch points greatly decreases when they
are close together I presume this is an issue with capacitive
screens and not a software issue. This issue hasn&#8217;t shown itself
till now since the other games are faster paced and acurracy is
less important.<br>
Second issue is motion jitters. This occurs when hold a target
object in place. One would expect the item to never move, but thats
not what happens. After a few seconds the held piece will violently
spring around the touch point. This happens due to how the touch
sensor provides me the information. I get touch events in 3 main
categories: down, move, and up. (I&#8217;m specifically ignoring cancel
for now.) On down I add a heavy mass to the touched object. This
makes it practically immobile from impacts by other objects. When I
get a move event I add linear velocity to the object so it can
shift to the touched coordinate. If the finger is down and but
never moves, I don&#8217;t get any other events from the sensor which
tell me that it&#8217;s still down. I need to rely on an up event to
negate the down. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t always get the up event or
even the cancel &#8230;&#8230;.</p>

  <p>
    <p>Just updated to the trunk build of AndEngine which broke almost
every line of code I had. There were a bunch of renamings that
occurred to replace the concept of scene layers with a more generic
child entity structure. The shape modifiers also got moved to
another package to differentiate from particle modifiers.<br>
All in all, the transition was smooth and I will now be able to
contribute to code back into the main source tree without as many
conflicts.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2011/finger-mechanics-help/">Finger Mechanics. Help!</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I am finding it near impossible to get a perfect simulation of
finger to table top physics. I&#8217;m not sure if this is a hardware
limitation or just my bad algorithm. In a previous post I had a
workable solution by dragging pieces around instead of teleporting,
and that does work enough. But now that the game is released I feel
the need to make is better.<br>
The issue with dragging is the delay that is percieved when moving
the object around very quickly. It looks like the object is chasing
your finger which breaks the illusion. Fortunately, none of the
mini-games use swirling but it bugs me in the Free Play mode.<br>
In the real world, we can put two coins on a table and push one
coins into the other. On a touch screen the coordinates come in
after the push which is already too late for a perfect sim. So I
think some predictive algorithm is in need.<br>
If I can take a previous position and the current I should be able
to predict the next and push the object there directly. Sadly, this
type of math is my worst suit and I don&#8217;t have the time to figure
it out. If anyone out there lives and breathes math, feel free to
comment with a solution. Otherwise the whole word will have to play
with drag physics or play a different game. Sad.</p>

  <p>
    <p>I believe I&#8217;m almost finished with some thing that I wouldn&#8217;t
hate being in the market. I know that standard seems a bit low, but
if I don&#8217;t release this thing soon it won&#8217;t ever get released.</p>


<p>The past sessions were all about artwork. This could have been a
long rabbit trail, but my wife reminded me to get this thing done.
And that every minute I send on this creation, I lose with my son.
Anyway, artwork is basically done. I have to crop here and there.
But I think it&#8217;s workable.</p>


<p>Here&#8217;s some things that are completed:</p>


<ol>
<li>game play of 2.5 mini games (2 full game, and a variation of
one of them)&nbsp;</li>
<li>working menus, even replaying a game</li>
<li>sound feed back for points in 1.5 of the games</li>
<li>theme and art work - most from&nbsp;<a href=
"http://www.lostgarden.com/search/label/free%20game%20graphics">http://www.lostgarden.com/search/label/free%20game%20graphics</a>
who has an amazingly flexible license which I couldn&#8217;t release this
thing without.</li>
<li>winning scenes and anxiety inducing count down when game is
about to end.</li>
</ol>


<p>Stuff yet to do before release:</p>


<ol>
<li>add credits scene to fulfill free licensing.</li>
<li>add sound to game 1</li>
<li>make replay more obvious on winning scene.</li>
</ol>


<p>Stuff to finish after release:</p>


<ol>
<li>More games</li>
<li>More sound effects</li>
<li>refactor code base so game 3 is easier</li>
<li>respond to user feed back</li>
<li>(never ending list)</li>
</ol>


<p>After release I&#8217;ll post images of the game&#8230;</p>

  <p>
    <p>Due to popular demand I added visual count down indicators. The
feature shows the second remaining on the screen then it explodes
away like a puff if smoke. This will be done by a nice little shape
modifier feature built into AndEngine. I want to apply 3 modifiers
in&nbsp;parallel:&nbsp;change alpha from 1 to 0 (visible to
invisible), scale 1 to 10 (normal to huge), and rotate 0 to 360.
This was easier said than done, because of a difference between
regular shapes and text. Regular shapes use alpha blending by
default, text <strong>doesn&#8217;t</strong>. Unfortunately, my first
suspect was the animation library, instead of blending. After an
hour troubleshooting I found out setAlpha on text wasn&#8217;t working
without any animation. This lead to googling &#8220;+AndEngine text
setAlpha&#8221;. The first hit saves the day with a one liner that sets
the blending mode of the
shape:<code>setBlendFunction(GL10.GL_SRC_ALPHA,
GL10.GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)</code></p>


<p>Why this isn&#8217;t the default like the other shapes is a mystery to
me.</p>


<p>As for the player positions, I learned how bad my geometry is
again. In four player mode there should be a &#8220;Ready?&#8221; touch area
for each player in each corner of the screen. The text should be
oriented so each player can view the text in the correct
perspective. This should be as simple as rotating the text in the
correct 45 degree increment. Sadly, it took me a shameful full hour
to figure out what those were. I&#8217;m sure if I stayed awake in that
class for the same hour I would have learned more than 4
numbers.&nbsp;AndEngine rotates clockwise so&nbsp;starting in the
upper right corner the rotational angles I &#8220;discovered&#8221; are: 135,
225, 45, and 315.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2011/day-7-finger-physics-is-hard/">Day 7 - Finger Physics is Hard</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>After struggling with this problem for quite some time, I think
the issue is finally licked. The problem relates to transferring
you fingers momentum to a virtual object on the screen. The natural
way to display finger position is to plot a sprite at the touch
sensors coordinates. The problem with this method is the physics
engine doesn&#8217;t think their is any momentum built up. The physics
engine just thinks your finger teleported there. So if I teleport
on top of a cow it just explodes. To make things worse if the touch
events come in too slowly you&#8217;ll teleport over the cow completely
missing the free lunch.</p>


<p>The initial solution I had for the issue was horrible. I figured
I could plot the sprite at the point of contact like before, then
calculate a force vector based on the last coordinate form the
previous touch event, divide by time and then tell the physics
engine to apply the force to the target. This gave me accurate
transfer of momentum, but looked ridiculous. The finger sprite kept
jumping forward as I moved my finger across the screen like a
horizontal jack hammer. So I thought I could divorce the finger
sprite from the physics engine, but then I&#8217;d have to keep track of
more objects and states of when to use physics (during a release)
and when to not use it (during a drag). Anyway, I chose not to go
down that path mainly because it felt like too many parts and I
have no time for debugging AND I was still teleporting. Doh!</p>


<p>The solution ultimately came to something very unnatural, but
completely sufficient. And it cut down my code significantly.
Probably in half. The affect I needed was to have the object I&#8217;m
dragging show up at my finger location and have momentum maintained
at release or collision. Did you catch that word? Dragging? That&#8217;s
how it hit me. The previous solution was to push the object, but if
I drag it things get simpler. In drag mode I just need to apply
enough force to the object to get it to my finger location. The
math for that is simple and the same as I mentioned in the first
solution: (current finger sprite position - current touch position)
/ time. When I apply the force, the physics engine moves the sprite
under my finger perfectly, and if it misses the next touch event
comes in to get it even closer. It a self correcting system.</p>


<p>The best part of the final solution is no more teleporting. We
don&#8217;t do it in real life and we shouldn&#8217;t do it in our games
either. Maybe one day I&#8217;ll add the complexity to push the object
instead of drag, but for now I&#8217;ll leave that as an exercise to the
reader.</p>

  <p>
    <p>I&#8217;ve been a bit lax on updates due to spending any free time on
the game mechanics.</p>


<p>The overhead physics is now about right with some polish needed
around transfer of momentum from the touch event to a game object.
AndEngine, or really any game engine, doesn&#8217;t make touching and
physics work well together. If you want to make an Angry Birds
clone that would be easy, but making your finger the bird is much
harder&#8230; unless it&#8217;s that other bird&#8230;</p>


<p>Anyway, I finally have the first mini-game completed. It is
called Keep Away, with the simple concept of keeping stuff away
from the opponent. There are basic menus, dialogs, game time, and
game over transitions. I can now play test with my wife, who thinks
the best part is the clucking noise when things collide. Hopefully
that won&#8217;t be the the only highlight.</p>


<p>I would post a screenshot but it&#8217;s still a bit too ugly for the
Internet.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the result of a couple hours of work. The cards are
touchable<br>
and you can move more than one card at a time. The engine allows me
to<br>
hold a card under each finger and rotate my phone in a 360 and
it<br>
tracks my fingers perfectly. I was able to stitch together the
basic<br>
functions because of the numerous example provided by<br>

<p>I&#8217;ve decided to use AndEngine to do the first version of the game.
It<br>
has a ton of example source, and seems to be easy enough to use.
I<br>
guess I should have looked harder before doing the previous post.
I&#8217;ve also talked with several colleagues and they validated the<br>
general game mechanics. As for the rest of my evening, I will
attempt to get AndEngine up and<br>
running and maybe get an animated sprite drawn before the nights
out.<br>
Woot!</p>

<li>game input - multi-touch with ability to track which user is
touching the screen.</li>
<li>game engine - I don&#8217;t know of any good base game engines out
there that will give me a head start on this project. The few I&#8217;ve
seen are probably too big for me needs.</li>
<li>art work and sound - I&#8217;ll probably need to get some help on
this one.</li>
<li>time - I&#8217;m guessing I&#8217;ll only have a couple hours a week to
spend, so there&#8217;s a chance this won&#8217;t get done till Android is
dead.</li>
</ol>


<p>More to come soon&#8230;</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2010/how-to-pass-click-events-to-android-child-vie/">How to pass click events to Android child views</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>When dealing with child views in Android, nesting views with
touch events can wipe out basic onClick behavior. This can turn a
happy developer into a &#8220;punch stranger in the face&#8221; developer in no
time flat. To return the rabbit developer back to normal, I scraped
together the following snippet.</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p1">View innerMostChild(MotionEvent event) {</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">return</span> innerMostChild(event,
<span class="s1">this</span>, 0);</p>
<p class="p1">}</p>
<p class="p1">View innerMostChild(MotionEvent event, ViewGroup
view, <span class="s1">int</span> nesting) {</p>
<p class="p1">View result = <span class="s1">null</span>;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">final</span> <span class=
"s1">float</span> x = event.getX();</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">final</span> <span class=
"s1">float</span> y = event.getY();</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for</span> (<span class=
"s1">int</span> i = view.getChildCount() - 1; i &gt;= 0; i&#8211;) {</p>
<p class="p1">View child = view.getChildAt(i);</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span>// check if click is within
bounds</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">if</span> (x &gt;= child.getLeft()
&amp;&amp; x &lt; child.getRight() &amp;&amp; y &gt;=
child.getTop() &amp;&amp; y &lt; child.getBottom()) {</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">if</span> (<span class=
"s3">logv</span>) Log.v(<span class="s3">TAG</span>,
String.format(<span class="s4">&#8220;&gt;%&#8221;</span> + (nesting == 0 ?
<span class="s4">&#8221;&#8221;</span> : nesting * 2) + <span class="s4">&#8221;s
child: %s&#8221;</span>, <span class="s4">&#8221;&#8221;</span>,
child.getClass().getSimpleName()));</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<span class="s1">if</span> (child <span class=
"s1">instanceof</span> ViewGroup) {</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; result =
innerMostChild(event, (ViewGroup) child, nesting+1);</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }
<span class="s1">else</span> {</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; result = child;</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }</p>
<p class="p1">}</p>
<p class="p1">}</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">return</span> result;</p>
<p class="p1">}</p>
</blockquote>


<p class="p1"><span class="c1">Then make the call to your
innerMostChild within your GestureDetector:</span></p>


<blockquote>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="c2">@Override</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">public</span> <span class=
"s1">boolean</span> onSingleTapUp(MotionEvent e) {</p>
<p class="p2">View child = innerMostChild(e);</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">if</span> (child != <span class=
"s1">null</span>) {</p>
<p class="p2">child.performClick();</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"></span>return true<span class=
"s2">;</span></p>
<p class="p2">}</p>
<p class="p3">return false<span class="s2">;</span></p>
<p class="p2">}</p>
</blockquote>


<p class="p2"><span class="c3">This isn&#8217;t quite production ready
code, so I&#8217;ll leave refactoring to whoever wants to use
it.</span></p>


<p class="p2"><span class="c3">I might post the whole file if some
one asks nicely.</span></p>


<p class="p2"><span class="c3">PS. Sorry strange, I couldn&#8217;t help
it.</span></p>

How To Search Your Source With Grep</a></div>
<div class="c2">via <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/" class=
"f">ReadWriteWeb</a> by Pete Warden on 11/10/10</div>
<br class="c3">
<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/grepshot_main.png"
height="88" alt="grepshot_main.png" width="150">One of the joys of
the last decade has been the growing ubiquity of Unix, and one of
its most useful tools is grep. Even if you&#8217;re using an IDE for your
development, the odds are that you&#8217;ll be able to search your code
faster and more flexibly once you learn this command line tool.
It&#8217;s not always obvious how to access all that power though, so
I&#8217;ll show you some of my favorite techniques. The examples have
been tested on OS X&#8217;s GNU grep, but should be applicable to most
versions. You can download <a href=
"http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> if you want to run this and
other Unix tools on Windows.</p>
<p><em>Sponsor</em><br>
<a href=
"http://d.ads.readwriteweb.com/ck.php?n=22975&amp;cb=22975"><img src="http://d.ads.readwriteweb.com/avw.php?zoneid=14&amp;cb=22975&amp;n=22975"
border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p><strong><em>grep -inIEr &#8211;color=ALWAYS &#8220;Foo.*=&#8221;
source/code/directory/</em></strong></p>
<p>This is the way I use grep most frequently, and first here&#8217;s
what those cryptic options mean. The lower-case &#8220;i&#8221; means that the
search is going to be case-insensitive, and the &#8220;n&#8221; asks the tool
to print the line number next to each match. The big &#8220;I&#8221; means grep
uses some impressive guesswork to figure out which files are binary
not text, and skips matching those. The upper-case &#8220;E&#8221; tells the
tool to treat the pattern as a <a href=
"http://www.regular-expressions.info/posix.html">Posix extended
regular expression</a>, since the default of basic is very limited
in what you can express. Finally the lower &#8220;r&#8221; prepares the tool to
look at all the files and sub-folders within the main directory you
specify. The last option switch causes the matched parts of the
result lines to be highlighted in color.</p>
<p>The third argument is the pattern you want to match, and the
only gotcha to watch out for here is that you need to enclose it in
either single or double quotes to make sure none of the characters
are misinterpreted as shell commands. Learning regular expressions
can be daunting, but knowing that &#8220;.&#8221; matches any single character
and &#8220;.*&#8221; matches zero or more of any character can get you
surprisingly far. The last argument is the directory that contains
your source code. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/grepshot.png" height=
"87" alt="grepshot.png" width="610">
<p>The results are all the matching lines in the source code files,
with the file name and line number at the start of each line. On OS
X you can then open them up in your favorite editor by cutting and
pasting the file name into the <strong><em>open</em></strong>
command, eg</p>
<p><strong><em>open maprender/src/maprender.mxml</em></strong></p>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Sometimes just seeing a single line isn&#8217;t enough context to
understand if it&#8217;s a match you&#8217;re interested in, and that&#8217;s where
the <strong><em>-C</em></strong> option comes in handy. You specify
a number of lines to show before and after the match, which gives
you something a bit more like the webpage snippets search engines
show for each result:</p>
<p><strong><em>grep -inIEr &#8211;color=ALWAYS -C1 &#8220;Foo.*=&#8221;
source/code/directory/</em></strong></p>
<img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/grepshot2.png" height=
"282" alt="grepshot2.png" width="610">
<h2>File types</h2>
<p>Often you want to narrow down your search to files written in a
particular language, and this is where you need the
<strong><em>&#8211;include</em></strong> option. You specify another
pattern (confusingly it&#8217;s a <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_%28programming%29">glob</a> not
a full regular expression), and only files with names that match it
are searched.</p>
<p><strong><em>grep -inIEr &#8211;color=ALWAYS &#8211;include=&#8221;*.php&#8221;
&#8220;Foo.*=&#8221; source/code/directory/</em></strong></p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2010/need-text-editor-for-ipad/">Need Text Editor for iPad</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Need Text Editor for iPad Well a dug around again for a test editor
on the iPad and came up empty handed again. I&#8217;ve been using vim
more and more and think I&#8217;m almost to the point where I can live in
it for my non coding endeavors, but I can&#8217;t seem to find something
like it on the iPad. I did consider using iSSH but that would
require me to connect to a server that has it, and I&#8217;m not always
connected. I think I&#8217;m just going to have to live with working in
notes for now.<br>
I also looked at Bespin from Mozilla which has been renamed to
Skywritter. The project seems promising and the transition from a
cloud based services to a JavaScript editor feels right. This also
reminds me CodeMirror, a project that&#8217;s also doing JavaScript code
editing, but that never quite worked out for me.<br>
The dream is to one day manage and update a server remotely and not
need to pull down source to make changes. It could be interesting
to have a server do some of the heavy lifting of a project. For
instance, maybe do some continual integration or keep a strong
index of changes as they are being made. It would also be
interesting to do some of the things that Google Wave did but with
code. I can imaging 2 people pairing on code remotely making
adjustments on the fly. Let one person write the main line, and the
spotter makes the minor fixes along the way. There are plenty of
other things that would make collaboration difficult like resolving
code conflicts or what happens when some one changes the signature
of a method that your using. But I think a lot of these are just
tweaks to existing collaboration issues, and not super sized road
blocks.<br>
Back to the real world, I just hope to find a nice text editor for
the iPad so I can get my fixed with fonts back along with auto
indentation and some syntax highlighting.</p>

  <p>
    <p>If I was running a Rails shop, I would be here. But in the big

height="60" alt="Heroku.jpg" width="150">The number of apps hosted
on the Ruby platform <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> has
increased 50 percent since November, pointing out how cloud-based
platforms are becoming the norm for the capabilities the services
provide in terms of testing and reliability.</p>
<p>Heroku had more than <a href=
"http://gigaom.com/2009/11/23/the-state-of-cloud-startup-heroku-now-hosting-40000-apps/">
40,000 apps</a> on its platform last November. Now more than 60,000
apps are using the Heroku service.</p>
<p>Heroku&#8217;s success is not alone. Amazon Web Services (AWS) and
Rackspace are rapidly expanding. AWS announced its expansion to the
Asia Pacific region this past week. In its announcement, AWS
featured Kim Eng, one of Asia&#8217;a largest security brokers. The firm
said the availability of the AWS service helped minimize its
latency for its KE Trade iPhone application.</p>

<p>Rackspace developer <a href=
"http://www.rackspacecloud.com/blog/2010/03/04/ipad-app-development-behind-the-scenes/">
Mike Mayo</a> built the <a href=
"http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2010/04/does-amazons-rivalry-with-appl.php">
company&#8217;s latest iPad app</a> for customers to monitor Rackspace
cloud networks. He said the cloud provides a way for developers to
test with better efficiency. For example, using cloud platforms,
apps are continually tested for bugs. Those bugs can be fixed one
at a time as they pop up. That&#8217;s easier than doing a build and then
fixing the 20 bugs that are discovered.</p>
<h2>Heroku</h2>
<p>Heroku is a Ruby-on-Rails platform that according to the company
web site &#8220;eliminates the need to manage servers, slices or
clusters.&#8221; Developers focus on the code and that&#8217;s pretty much
it.</p>
<p>Heroku hosts the <a href=
"http://flightcaster.com">Flightcaster</a> application, an
interesting example of a service that uses two cloud providers to
serve its app. Flightcaster is a service that checks your flight to
see if it is on time. It can predict up to six hours in advance if
your flight will be late.</p>
<p><img src=

height="408" alt="FlightCaster1.jpg" width="610"></p>
<p>Flightcaster uses Heroku to serve the application. But the
actual data analysis is done through Amazon S3 where Hadoop manages
the data analytics. The data is passed from Heroku to Amazon S3 and
then back to Heroku where it is served back to the customer making
the request.</p>

type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent"
allowscriptaccess="never" height="225" width="400"></p>
<p>Heroku is an example of a service that is making it infinitely
easier for developers to develop and manage applications. It&#8217;s part
of a new breed of platforms emerging that are growing in
popularity.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see if Heroku will grow 100 percent over the span of a
year. That would mean 80,000 apps. Seems plausible, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>If you have a child, you want him or her to be prepared for the
future. So why not begin their dreary cubicle farm confinement
before they even learn how to read? That&#8217;s what the Little Tykes
Young Explorer does, combining a home cubicle and child-sized
seating with a computer loaded with kid-friendly software, all at a
rather inflated price. Which is a lot like real office furniture,
come to think of it.</p>
<p>The Young Explorer costs $2,599. What that get you?</p>
<p><strong>Furniture features:</strong><br></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Flat desk area</li>
<li class="c4"><br></li>
<li>Left and Right built-in mouse pads</li>
<li class="c4"><br></li>
<li>Bench seat that fits two children and offers storage inside for
supplies</li>
<li class="c4"><br></li>
<li>Two locking cabinet doors</li>
<li class="c4"><br></li>
<li>Computer wiring stores safely inside ventilated cabinet.</li>
<li class="c4"><br></li>
<li>Locking castors keep unit from rolling during use.</li>
<li class="c4"><strong>Computer equipment features:</strong><br>

<li>Trudy&#8217;s Time and Place&Acirc;&reg;</li>
<li>Thinkin&#8217; Things&Acirc;&reg;</li>
</ul>
<p>The set appears to be geared for schools, libraries, day care
centers, and the like, but it&#8217;s funnier to think of it as the
white-collar cousin to the <a href=
"http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3695463&amp;CAWELAID=367517049">
McDonald&#8217;s cashier playset</a>.</p>
<p>Considering that ThinkCentre PCs start at around $350 for the
base model, and you can get a more attractive child&#8217;s computer desk
for a few hundred bucks (or even less) this becomes an even more
baffling product.</p>

exhaustive remedies for hundreds of common, hard-to-remove stains
in one easy-to-search resource&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;with surprising
specificity. Did that coffee stain come with cream or no cream?

We all had that someone&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;mom, dad, aunt,
neighbor&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;who told us everything we needed to
know about parallel parking. Over time, we lose some of it, and
pick up bad habits. Drop back into driver&#8217;s ed with a smart video.

<p>Cosmin Lehene &iuml;&raquo;&iquest;wrote two excellent articles
on Adobe&#8217;s experiences with HBase: <a href=
"http://hstack.org/why-were-using-hbase-part-1/">Why
we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re using HBase: Part 1</a> and <a href=
"http://hstack.org/why-were-using-hbase-part-2/">Why
we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re using HBase: Part 2</a>. Adobe needed a
<em>generic,</em> <em>real-time, structured data storage and
processing system that could handle any data volume, with access
times under 50ms, with no downtime and</em> no data loss. The
article goes into great detail about their experiences with HBase
and their evaluation process, providing a &#8220;well reasoned impartial
use case from a commercial user&#8221;. It talks about failure handling,
availability, write performance, read performance, random reads,
sequential scans, and consistency.&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the knocks against HBase has been it&#8217;s complexity, as it
has many parts that need installation and configuration. All is not
lost according to the Adobe team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HBase is more complex than other systems (you need Hadoop,
Zookeeper, cluster machines have multiple roles). We believe that
for HBase, this is not accidental complexity and that the argument
that &acirc;&euro;&oelig;HBase is not a good choice because it is
complex&acirc;&euro; is irrelevant. The advantages far outweigh the
problems. Relying on decoupled components plays nice with the Unix
philosophy: do one thing and do it well. Distributed storage is
delegated to HDFS, so is distributed processing, cluster state goes
to Zookeeper. All these systems are developed and tested
separately, and are good at what they do. More than that, this
allows you to scale your cluster on separate vectors. This is not
optimal, but it&Acirc;&nbsp;<strong>allows for incremental
investment</strong> in either spindles, CPU or RAM. You
don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have to add them all at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Highly recommended, especially if you need some sort of balance
to the recent gush of Cassandra articles.&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>

Reinventing the Handshake: Polite Servers and Smart Networks Lead
to Active Security</a></div>
<div class="c2">via <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/" class=
"f">ReadWriteWeb</a> by Mike Kirkwood on 3/4/10</div>
<br class="c3">
<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/handshake.jpg"
height="200" alt="handshake.jpg" width="150">If there was a
real-time tag cloud for the RSA conference this year, three words
would be in big bold letters: Security (of course), Cloud, and
Virtualization. Paul Congdon, from HP&#8217;s ProCurve Networking group
gave us a view into the not-so-distant future where servers, like
good house guests, knock before entering. In this case, it&#8217;s the
link they request, and to get it they will properly announce
themselves and their intentions to allow the host to prepare to
accommodate them.</p>
<p>This capability is a linchpin in removing the process bottleneck
in provisioning new services in the data center. For most
organizations, the network is manually configured. To keep up with
the movement of the provisioning of virtual machines, the network
needs to enable &#8220;plug and play&#8221;.</p>
<p class="c4"><em>Sponsor</em><br>
<a href=
"http://d.ads.readwriteweb.com/ck.php?n=18526&amp;cb=18526"><img src="http://d.ads.readwriteweb.com/avw.php?zoneid=14&amp;cb=18526&amp;n=18526"
border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<h2>Complexity Means Controls</h2>
<p>The network is in a unique postion as a &#8220;pipe&#8221; as well as a
&#8220;control&#8221; where it needs to know what communications go where and
plays the role of traffic cop.</p>
<p>This means opening ports between servers, controlling traffic
and setting monitors to make sure traffic is optimized. When things
change, configuration does as well, especially when a new service
is requested. Today, this is controlled by human processes and
controls to keep the network up to date with the applications and
servers that host them.</p>
<p><img src=
"http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/congdonNetworkSwitches.jpg"
height="356" alt="congdonNetworkSwitches.jpg" width="610"></p>
<p>In the future, there is the opportunity to move forward in
auto-configuration or even smarter handshakes.</p>
<p>In essence, to oversee this process a directory or resources or
inventory would exist that allows the network to &#8220;know&#8221; what is in
place within it. This is a new control point for the data center,
and is a resource to the network.</p>
<p><img src=
"http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/congdonSmartNetwork.jpg" height=
"343" alt="congdonSmartNetwork.jpg" width="610"></p>
<h2>Solutions in Protocols</h2>
<p>802.1.x is technology that has been used in WiFi connections.
One reason it was useful in that context is that it&#8217;s expected that
the link drops and reconnects frequently and so is seen as an
opportunity for the physical link as well.</p>
<p><img src=
"http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/802.1RevisionHistoryFull.jpg"
height="335" alt="802.1RevisionHistoryFull.jpg" width="610"></p>
<p>The potential upgrades to 802.1 would enable a richer dialog
between the server as it starts up its networking process. This
would allow the server to announce itself and its requirements
(e.g. encryption) and allow the network to respond to these
appropriately (e.g. set encryption key). This process can become a
big win for configuration management where now, the server can come
up in the network and be provisioned according to the policy.</p>
<p><img src=
"http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/802.1ServerFramework.jpg"
height="282" alt="802.1ServerFramework.jpg" width="610"></p>
<p>All of this reminds us of the benefits of a company like Apple.
Having the unique opportunity to control the model from end to end
means have the ability to make better tools. We wonder if natural
evolution will get multi-vendor shops a solution for all of their
IT assets.</p>
<p>What will it take to get to a model-driven data center?</p>

<p>Jeri Ellsworth is an American entrepreneur and self-taught
computer chip designer. She is best known for, in 2004, creating a
Commodore 64 emulator within a joystick, called Commodore 30-in-1
Direct to TV. The &#8220;computer in a joystick&#8221; could run 30 video games
from the early 1980s, and was very popular during the 2004
Christmas season, at peak selling over 70,000 units in a single day
via the QVC shopping channel. She is a pinball machine aficionado
and owns over 60 full-sized pinball arcade games.</p>

you, what Jeri made was really, <em>really</em> incredible. She
reverse engineered <em>and</em> designed the entire Commodore 64
audio and video system on a <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">field-programmable
gate array</a> (FPGA) and then managed to get it made cheap enough
so it could sold on QVC. A FPGA allows you to design circuits after
a chip was made&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&#8221;an integrated circuit designed
to be configured by the customer or designer after manufacturing.&#8221;
She went from prototype to a top-selling product, 70k in one

side mirrors doesn&#8217;t actually cover the blind spot outside the
driver&#8217;s vision. Car and Driver illustrates a car mirror setup
that, once you get used to it, could prevent lane change
freak-outs.</p>
<p>The auto magazine culls its mirror alignment diagram from a
paper published in 1995 by the Society of Automotive Engineers
(SAE). That paper suggested, basically, moving your side mirrors to
point further out into adjacent lanes, a trick that can take some
getting used to:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>The paper advocates adjusting the mirrors so far outward that
the viewing angle of the side mirrors just overlaps that of the
cabin&#8217;s rearview mirror. This can be disorienting for drivers used
to seeing the flanks of their own car in the side mirrors. But when
correctly positioned, the mirrors negate a car&#8217;s blind spots. This
obviates the need to glance over your shoulder to safely change
lanes as well as the need for an expensive blind-spot warning
system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the trick is to get the side mirrors aligned <em>just</em>
outside what your rearview mirror covers, and rely on your own
vision to cover the areas in your peripheral vision. Neat trick,
but as the magazine (and their commenters) mention, you&#8217;ll want to
train yourself on a neighborhood road before taking this setup out
on the interstate.</p>
<p>Check out the Car and Driver post for a full look and
explanation of the SAE-approved side mirror setup. Got a better
solution to your side mirror setup? Do tell in the comments.

"&lt;strong&gt;New Recipe&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Everyone who had a business told me, "><br>
<p>It&#8217;s Takeout Tuesday at Nick&#8217;s Pizza &amp; Pub, and the air is
thick with the smells of hot pizza crust, peppers, onions, and
cheese. Eighteen young men and women &#8211; most of them high school
age &#8211; form an assembly line between a row of worktables and a long
bank of pizza ovens. The kids laugh and shout, even as they focus
intently on their tasks.</p>
<p>Nick Sarillo, 47, stands halfway down the assembly line, holding
a giant wooden pizza board. As the company&#8217;s founder and CEO, he
doesn&#8217;t usually work the pizza line anymore. But he is happy to
lend a hand when he can, and the kitchen crew needs all the help it
can get on Tuesdays, thanks to a program Sarillo launched in March
2009 in response to the recession. A sign in the lobby explains the
logic behind the policy:</p>
<p class="c4">Kane County unemployment 6.3% vs. 11.1% Sept. 2008 &#8211;
Sept. 2009 &Acirc;&frac12; Price Monday and Takeout Tuesday are
here to stay until the unemployment lines go away.</p>
<p>That is, customers pay half price for pizza in the dining room
on Mondays and half price for carryout on Tuesdays. The effect has
been to turn the two slowest days of the week into the two busiest.
Indeed, the program proved so popular that it initially overwhelmed
the kitchens. &#8220;Our promise is to have pizzas ready in 15 minutes
with no mistakes,&#8221; says Sarillo. &#8220;We had so many orders that the
time got up to 25 minutes. Guests were getting upset. It was OK if
I was here to orchestrate, but it got pretty bad if I wasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what did he do? &#8220;I built a system to replace me,&#8221; Sarillo
says. &#8220;I put together a checklist of things that had to be done by
4 p.m., so we could handle the volume. It took about four weeks
until it could work without me. Now we&#8217;re nailing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are, according to the trade magazine Pizza Today, 70,000
to 75,000 pizza establishments in the United States. Nearly every
town has at least one, and &#8211; except for arguing over which makes
the finest slices &#8211; people seldom pay them much notice, let alone
think of them as a potential source of business and management
wisdom.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s Nick&#8217;s Pizza &amp; Pub.</p>
<p>Its two restaurants in the northwest suburbs of Chicago have
attracted visitors from far and wide who have heard about Sarillo&#8217;s
approach to management and the effect it has had on employees. The
numbers tell the tale. In an industry in which annual employee
turnover of 200 percent is considered normal, Sarillo&#8217;s restaurants
lose and replace just 20 percent of their staff members every year.
Net operating profit in the industry averages 6.6 percent;
Sarillo&#8217;s runs about 14 percent and has gone as high as 18 percent.
Meanwhile, the 14-year-old company does more volume on a per-unit
basis (an average of $3.5 million over the past three years) than
nearly all independent pizza restaurants. And customers, it seems,
adore the service: On three occasions, waitresses have received
tips of $1,000.</p>
<p>Sarillo grew up around pizza. His father, Nick Sr., owned a
restaurant called Village Pizza in Carpentersville, Illinois, which
he started when his son was in the eighth grade. When Sarillo
opened his first restaurant, in Crystal Lake, in 1995 (the other
opened in nearby Elgin in 2005), he patterned it after his
father&#8217;s, right down to the pizza recipe. In one key respect,
however, he was determined to make it different. That difference &#8211;
and the secret of the company&#8217;s success &#8211; can be summed up in one
word: culture.</p>
<p>Sarillo has built his company&#8217;s culture by using a form of
management best characterized as &#8220;trust and track.&#8221; It involves
educating employees about what it takes for the company to be
successful, then trusting them to act accordingly. The alternative
is command and control, wherein success is the boss&#8217;s
responsibility and employees do what the boss says. Think of the
Navy SEALs versus the National Guard. Both approaches can work, but
they produce very different cultures. If done right, moreover,
trust and track can allow a company to be nimble, flexible, and
productive enough to perform at the highest level through good
economies and bad.</p>
<p>Sarillo is the first to admit that he is an unlikely spokesman
for the benefits of a strong company culture. When he launched
Nick&#8217;s, he had never heard of company culture. A former
construction worker, he got into the business, he says, because he
had three young children and there was no restaurant in the area at
which families could get together, kids could play, and parents
could relax and have fun. He didn&#8217;t have a management philosophy &#8211;
at least not one he could articulate. He did believe, however, that
he had a choice about how the business would be run. &#8220;Everyone I
knew who&#8217;d had a business told me, &#8216;No one cares like an owner. No
one works as hard as an owner,&#8217; &#8221; Sarillo says. &#8220;They said, &#8216;Watch
out. People are going to steal.&#8217; I set out to prove them wrong. I
wanted a place where everyone worked hard and cared a lot; where
people enjoyed coming to work, felt good afterward, and weren&#8217;t
motivated to steal. If I couldn&#8217;t have that kind of business, I
didn&#8217;t want to have a business.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end, he built the kind of business he wanted by
developing a unique management system. Not only is it strikingly
effective, but it&#8217;s a stark illustration of the notion that good
ideas can spring from the most humble of sources. If you look
closely, you can identify 10 key ingredients of Sarillo&#8217;s recipe
for building a company culture that delivers.</p>
1. Feel your community&#8217;s pain; share its joy
<p>Half-Price Mondays and Takeout Tuesdays are symbols of Nick&#8217;s
ongoing commitment to the communities in which it operates. So was
a decision in August 2008 to surprise the guests one Thursday
evening by picking up the check, in recognition of the tough times
many were facing. &#8220;It cost us $20,000,&#8221; says Sarillo&#8217;s partner,
Christopher Adams, &#8220;but it created tremendous buzz.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also reinforced the company&#8217;s reputation as a community
bulwark &#8211; a reputation it has been assiduously building since Day
One. The restaurants host fundraisers almost every week, with the
company contributing 15 percent of the gross profit generated by
the event. In addition, Nick&#8217;s sponsors two or three large benefits
a year, many of them for families facing high medical bills because
of a health crisis. For the benefits, the company donates 100
percent of its gross profit for the day, and servers often kick in
their tips. &#8220;I have never known them to turn away anyone with a
legitimate charitable purpose,&#8221; says Crystal Lake Mayor Aaron
Shepley.</p>
<p>All of this has an ancillary benefit for the business. &#8220;It
reminds our team members how incredibly different we are from any
other place they know,&#8221; says Adams.</p>
2. Hire only A+ players
<p>Forty-one percent of the company&#8217;s 182 employees are ages 16 to
18, almost all of them still in high school. The others include a
large number of mothers, college students, and people whose main
job is somewhere else. Such employees do not typically make for a
stable work force. Yet people who work at Nick&#8217;s seem to find the
culture irresistible. &#8220;When I come here, I really don&#8217;t feel like
I&#8217;m coming to work,&#8221; says server Aubrey Judson, 25. &#8220;My boyfriend
doesn&#8217;t understand it. I just like to be here.&#8221; She works only on
weekends, she adds, as she has a full-time job at an online
advertising agency during the week.</p>
<p>Her job as a server was very likely the more difficult of the
two to land. Just one of every 12 applicants to Nick&#8217;s gets hired.
&#8220;I was really surprised by the process,&#8221; she says. &#8220;You get
interviewed twice, and you take a personality test.&#8221;</p>
<p>The explicit goal of the process is to hire only the best of the
best &#8211; A+ players, in the language of the company. People who
inquire about a job receive a handout detailing the company&#8217;s
purpose and values. They are advised not to waste their time
applying unless, after perusing the sheet, they think Nick&#8217;s sounds
like a place they would like to work. If they decide to move
forward, they first have a talk with a manager. Nearly all of them
are then invited to an interview. Twenty percent of those are
invited to a second interview. Two managers are in each interview,
and one sits in on both. In other words, candidates need four yes
votes from three managers to receive an offer. Those who aren&#8217;t
selected get a thank-you note and a voucher for a free pizza.</p>
<p>Along the way, the applicants are scrutinized and tested. There
is a lot of role playing, not to mention the occasional
off-the-wall question. &#8220;They asked me, &#8216;What are you doing to
improve yourself physically, mentally, or spiritually?&#8217; &#8221; says
Scott Jewitt, who had been a manager at Bennigan&#8217;s, Lone Star
Steakhouse, Boston Market, Panera Bread, and CiCi&#8217;s Pizza before
joining Nick&#8217;s in the fall of 2008 and now is an operating partner.
&#8220;I was speechless for a moment. It was so different from any
interview experience I&#8217;d been through. And I&#8217;m not an amateur.&#8221;
Ninety-six percent of those hired stay at least a year.</p>
3. Learn, grow, compensate
<p>Getting hired at Nick&#8217;s is a ticket &#8211; not just to a job, but to
the company&#8217;s training program, which is elaborate, rigorous, and
ongoing. It begins with a two-day orientation, which includes more
role playing and discussion of the company&#8217;s purpose, values, and
culture. That&#8217;s followed by 101, a four-hour stint in the kitchen,
where everybody goes through a basic pizza-making course. The new
hires then separate into work groups and move on to 201, in which
they are trained and certified in specific jobs. A pizza maker, for
example, may take two to four weeks to reach the level of
proficiency required for certification, after which she can make
pizzas on her own. When she gets certified in two other jobs &#8211;
say, salads and sandwiches &#8211; her wage goes from $8.25 to $9 per
hour. After certification in six positions, it increases to $9.50
an hour, and she gets a red hat. (Up to then, she has been wearing
a tan hat.) Certification in nine positions earns her a black hat
and a raise to $11 an hour.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s her choice, however, whether she goes for any
certifications beyond 201. She can stay at one certification as
long as she likes. Then again, she might want to go on to 301 and
become a trainer, which offers a variety of benefits, including
eligibility for profit sharing and preference in scheduling. To
qualify, she must achieve mastery in her certifications &#8211; that is,
a top rating on a one-to-five scale &#8211; and read the book Mastery:
The Keys to Success and Long-Term Fulfillment, by George Leonard.
She then takes a three-day course on communication and leadership.
At the end of the course, she receives a Leadership 301 Passport
with a checklist of 30 specific behaviors she is required to model
or recognize someone else modeling. She has five weeks to complete
the passport, which involves observing and describing two such
incidents for each behavior and getting a member of the leadership
team to sign off on it. Finally, she takes a train-the-trainer
course. On completion, she becomes a trainer.</p>
4. Systems are for building trust
<p>This is not the sort of training curriculum you expect to find
in a company doing just over $7 million a year in sales. Then
again, the same could be said about all of Nick&#8217;s systems &#8211; from
hiring to inventory management to the handling of workplace
conflict. Pretty much everything that happens in the business has
been thought through, defined, and taught, right down to the best
method for greeting a customer.</p>
<p>Take the process of opening and closing the kitchen. In a
typical restaurant, a supervisor is responsible for both, has a
long checklist of things to be done, and tells everyone what to do.
At Nick&#8217;s, by contrast, the whole kitchen crew is responsible. To
help people keep track of what needs to happen, there is a
laminated &#8220;ops card&#8221; for each task involved. Each ops card is red
at the top and green at the bottom and has its own slot in a
converted timecard holder. In the morning, when staff members come
in, the ops cards are in the slots with the red end showing.
Whenever a task is completed, someone turns over the corresponding
ops card so the green end is showing. By closing time, all the
cards are showing green. It&#8217;s then the manager&#8217;s job to make sure
they are all red again before people arrive the next morning.</p>
<p>The system is an important mechanism for creating a
trust-and-track culture and for breaking the habits of command and
control. &#8220;Managers trained in command and control think it&#8217;s their
responsibility to tell people what to do,&#8221; Sarillo says. &#8220;They like
having that power. It gives them their sense of self-worth. But
when you manage that way, people see it, and they start waiting for
you to tell them what to do. You wind up with too much on your
plate, and things fall through the cracks. It&#8217;s not efficient or
effective. We want all the team members to feel responsible for the
company&#8217;s success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some people would no doubt find such a regime unbearable, but
Nick&#8217;s employees appear to thrive under it, especially the high
school students. &#8220;Parents tell me, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know what you did to my
kid, but whatever it is, keep doing it,&#8217; &#8221; says Sarillo.</p>
<p>What Sarillo has done, on one level, is simply to treat high
school students &#8211; and everyone else &#8211; like intelligent,
responsible, and, above all, trustworthy human beings. &#8220;All of our
systems are geared toward creating a culture of trust,&#8221; says
Sarillo. &#8220;A lot of people would say trust is intangible. We&#8217;ve made
it tangible by putting these systems in. They allow you to see
whether the trust is there and whether the way people behave is
promoting or undermining trust.&#8221;</p>
5. Coach in the moment, not after the fact
<p>To be sure, just about every company has systems of one sort or
another. A common one is the annual performance review, which
almost all management experts would say is essential for giving
employees the feedback they need. But Sarillo doesn&#8217;t believe in
performance reviews. Rather, managers and employees are trained to
coach in the moment, providing feedback immediately.</p>
<p>There are actually three forms of feedback at Nick&#8217;s. The first
is called a feedback loop and applies mainly to new employees. At
the end of a shift, a trainer will ask, &#8220;What is one thing you did
well, and &#8211; if you could replay the tape &#8211; what is one thing you
would do to enhance your performance?&#8221; It&#8217;s a two-way conversation,
hence a loop.</p>
<p>The second form is called performance feedback and, again,
usually comes at the end of a shift. After observing someone&#8217;s
performance, the manager or trainer will mention one thing the
person did well and one thing he or she should try to improve.</p>
<p>The third form is direct feedback and happens in the moment.
Suppose, for example, that Sarillo observes a host with her head
down as a guest walks by. &#8220;With a smile on my face and in a nice
way, I&#8217;d say, &#8216;Eyes up, Rhonda. Remember, five steps with every
guest.&#8217; &#8221; He is referring to another mechanism: Smile and greet a
customer whenever you come within five steps of one.</p>
<p>As for deciding when to provide feedback, managers are taught
that everything is an interview. &#8220;We do a lot of role playing in
our job interviews,&#8221; Sarillo says. &#8220;When you observe a behavior,
the question is, Would you have hired that behavior? If yes, you
can recognize it. If no, you can coach it. But either way, you
should do it in the moment.&#8221;</p>
6. A consultant can be more helpful than you think
<p>Sarillo says he first got the urge to expand to new locations in
2002, but he wasn&#8217;t confident in his ability to do it without
outside help. So he brought in an accountant and then a couple of
consultants. &#8220;They all talked about control, control, control,&#8221;
Sarillo says. &#8220;I felt like I was on Mars. What I was doing was
obviously working, but I didn&#8217;t know anyone else who ran a business
this way. I mean, I&#8217;m an ordinary guy. If I can do it, anybody
can.&#8221; Then he met a consultant named Rudy Miick. &#8220;He asked all the
right questions,&#8221; says Sarillo.</p>
<p>He decided to hire Miick, who didn&#8217;t come cheap. Sarillo
estimates that, in 2003 and 2004, he spent $200,000 preparing to
expand, 80 percent of which went to pay for Miick&#8217;s services.
That&#8217;s a lot of money for a business doing just over $3 million a
year in sales. But Miick played a key role in helping the
restaurants streamline their management systems, which helped
reduce employee turnover from 185 percent to 20 percent. Given a
cost of $1,500 to recruit, interview, and train a new employee, the
drop in turnover alone saved almost $250,000 a year.</p>
7. Turn negatives into positives by making talk safe
<p>Sarillo uses a system called safe space, which allows employees
and managers to have difficult conversations by following certain
well-defined rules. One rule, for example, is that statements must
be based on data, not feelings or speculation. Another rule is to
identify &#8220;the moose in the room&#8221; &#8211; that is, something many people
are aware of but no one is talking about &#8211; the goal being to nip
gossip and rumors in the bud. Adams, for one, feels that safe space
is &#8220;the most important way we create trust in the
organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>One team member recently used safe space to question Sarillo
about a sarcastic remark he had made. Sarillo had intended it to be
good-natured joshing, but it came across as pointed criticism. &#8220;I
said, &#8216;Holy cow! I didn&#8217;t realize it,&#8217; and I apologized,&#8221; Sarillo
says. &#8220;It reminded me that sarcasm can be lethal when you&#8217;re the
boss. I have my share of imperfections, and I love it when team
members call me out on them. It&#8217;s not a threat if you have a
culture based on trust. In fact, it proves that the trust is
there.&#8221;</p>
8. &#8220;Why&#8221; is more important than &#8220;what&#8221; or &#8220;how&#8221;
<p>Sarillo likes to say he doesn&#8217;t tell people what to do. Instead,
he prefers to explain the situation and let them choose. Of course,
giving people choices rather than orders requires trusting them to
do the right thing. But it works the other way as well: They have
to trust you enough to believe your explanation of the situation.
That means making sure they understand why they are being asked to
do whatever it is you want them to do.</p>
<p>Explaining the &#8220;why&#8221; is particularly important, Sarillo says,
for young employees. &#8220;Today&#8217;s teens are as strong and as good as
any previous generation of workers, but you need to share the &#8216;why&#8217;
with them. The days of &#8216;do what I tell you&#8217; are gone. You simply
won&#8217;t be successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>That can present a challenge for managers accustomed to giving
orders, as Sarillo discovered the hard way. In 2005, he and Adams
set a goal of having five restaurants by the end of 2010. To
achieve it, they realized they would need experienced general
managers to run the restaurants they had. The three people they
wound up hiring came out of established restaurant chains. On the
surface, the managers embraced the company&#8217;s purpose and values, as
well as the systems that support them. Eventually, however, Sarillo
decided he had to let all of them go. One tip-off was their
inability to control costs.</p>
<p>As usual, the devil was in the details. Each Nick&#8217;s Pizza &amp;
Pub has a just-in-time purchasing system, whereby food and beverage
usage is tracked daily and orders are placed two or three times a
week. A physical inventory is done once a week and then matched
against the prior week&#8217;s count, minus usage, plus purchases, to
make sure the costs are under control. The goal is to keep beverage
costs at about 22 percent of revenue and food costs at 20
percent.</p>
<p>But week after week, the costs ran too high, and physical
inventory counts didn&#8217;t jibe with usage and purchases. When Sarillo
finally investigated the problem, he traced it to the managers&#8217;
inability to let go of their old habits. &#8220;Their idea of leadership
was telling people what to do,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They had someone else put
in the numbers, and when the numbers came out wrong, they didn&#8217;t
dig deeper to discover why. Because they didn&#8217;t know the &#8216;why,&#8217;
they couldn&#8217;t share it with the team members. When you know the
&#8216;why,&#8217; it&#8217;s really easy to figure out what to do, but sharing that
kind of information wasn&#8217;t how they&#8217;d been trained to manage.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end, Sarillo turned over the responsibility for tracking
costs at the Elgin restaurant to a 24-year-old woman named Jenny
Petersen, who had begun working at Nick&#8217;s when she was 16. She
solved the problems in four weeks. She could do it, she says,
because she cared about the &#8216;why.&#8217; &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a matter of
personal drive and ambition,&#8221; Petersen says. &#8220;You need the drive to
ask questions and do the research. If our inventory numbers are
off, there&#8217;s got to be a reason. I like finding out what it
is.&#8221;</p>
9. &#8220;Trust&#8221; without &#8220;track&#8221; is an invitation to trouble
<p>In retrospect, Sarillo acknowledges that hiring those managers
was one of his biggest mistakes in recent years. It became a big
mistake, however, because he wasn&#8217;t paying attention. For two
years, he was totally focused on laying the groundwork for a new
Nick&#8217;s in Chicago, which was supposed to open in mid-2008. Only
after that plan fell through did he turn his attention back to the
existing restaurants. The company was in serious trouble, mainly
because he had invested so much time, energy, and money &#8211; about
$300,000 &#8211; in the Chicago project, but also because of slumping
sales and out-of-control costs at Elgin and Crystal Lake.</p>
<p>From a distance, he attributed the problems to economic factors
over which the company had no control. But as he looked more
closely, he realized there was more to it. The cost-control issues
were symptomatic of something deeper. The general managers weren&#8217;t
supporting the systems, and so the company&#8217;s culture was beginning
to change.</p>
<p>And yet Sarillo had to admit that the problems were ultimately
his responsibility. Looking back, he says, &#8220;The big lesson is
accountability. Results are results. You have to be real about how
people are doing. I wasn&#8217;t holding those managers accountable for
their results and their behavior because I wasn&#8217;t keeping close
enough track of what they were doing.&#8221;</p>
10. Beware of growing before you &#8211; and the company &#8211; are ready
<p>Sarillo didn&#8217;t keep track in part because he was mesmerized by
growth. He had decided to expand into Chicago, in the belief that a
Nick&#8217;s there would provide visibility the company could never get
in Crystal Lake and Elgin.</p>
<p>He was eventually forced to cancel the Chicago project, however,
when he lost his bank financing in mid-2008. The turn of events
appeared at first to be a disaster for the company. It turned out,
however, to be a blessing. &#8220;Because we were not able to do Chicago,
we wound up doing something more important: fixing the culture in
Elgin and Crystal Lake,&#8221; says Sarillo. &#8220;If we&#8217;d opened in Chicago,
I wouldn&#8217;t have had so many financial problems, but I would have
had much, much bigger cultural problems. By the time I found out
about them, it might have been too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the process, he learned an important lesson about the type of
management he will need in the future. &#8220;I&#8217;ve decided there are two
ways to get the right person to run one of our restaurants,&#8221; he
says. &#8220;One, you can get a new manager like Jenny Petersen, who
hasn&#8217;t already developed bad habits somewhere else. Or, two, you
can get a manager with experience in the industry who&#8217;s completely
fed up with the corporate way of doing things and thinking, I
really need a change.&#8221; That&#8217;s the story with Scott Jewitt, the
operating partner at Crystal Lake.</p>
<p>So is Sarillo still committed to opening other Nick&#8217;s Pizza
&amp; Pubs? &#8220;Oh, yes, I feel more inspired to grow than ever,&#8221; he
says. &#8220;People really do want to have a meaningful place to work,
and that is one thing I know how to do well. So how could I not
want to keep doing it for more and more people? I mean, what could
be a more fulfilling life?&#8221;</p>

</div>
<a name="secondParagraph" id="secondParagraph"></a>
<p>The film won four Oscars, including best picture, best actor
and, for Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass, best original screenplay.
But it never would have been made if Mr. Morrow had not had a
chance meeting with Kim Peek, who inspired him to write the
film.</p>
<p>Mr. Peek was not autistic &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; not all savants
are autistic and not all autistics are savants &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
but he was born with severe brain abnormalities that impaired his
physical coordination and made ordinary reasoning difficult. He
could not dress himself or brush his teeth without help. He found
metaphoric language incomprehensible and conceptualization
baffling.</p>
<p>But with an astonishing skill that allowed him to read facing
pages of a book at once &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; one with each eye
&acirc;&euro;&rdquo; he read as many as 12,000 volumes. Even more
remarkable, he could remember what he had read.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Peek, who died Dec. 19 at home in Salt Lake City,
had perhaps the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s most capacious memory
for facts. He was 58. The cause was a heart attack, said his
father, Fran Peek.</p>
<p>Almost all documented savants &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; people with
an extraordinary depth of knowledge and the ability to recall it
&acirc;&euro;&rdquo; have been restricted in their expertise to
specific fields like mathematics, chess, art or music. But Mr. Peek
had a wide range of interests and could instantly answer the most
arcane questions on subjects as diverse as history, sports, music,
geography and movies.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;He was the Mount Everest of
memory,&acirc;&euro; Dr. Darold A. Treffert, an expert on savants
who knew Mr. Peek for 20 years, said in an interview.</p>
<p>Mr. Peek had memorized so many Shakespearean plays and musical
compositions and was such a stickler for accuracy, his father said,
that they had to stop attending performances because he would stand
up and correct the actors or the musicians.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;He&acirc;&euro;&trade;d stand up and say:
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;Wait a minute! The trombone is two notes
off,&acirc;&euro;&trade;&nbsp;&acirc;&euro; Fran Peek said.</p>
<p>Mr. Peek had an uncanny facility with the calendar.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;When an interviewer offered that he had been
born on March 31, 1956, Peek noted, in less than a second, that it
was a Saturday on Easter weekend,&acirc;&euro; Dr. Treffert and Dr.
Daniel D. Christensen wrote about Mr. Peek in Scientific American
in 2006.</p>
<p>They added: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;He knows all the area codes and
ZIP codes in the U.S., together with the television stations
serving those locales. He learns the maps in the front of phone
books and can provide MapQuest-like travel directions within any
major U.S. city or between any pair of them. He can identify
hundreds of classical compositions, tell when and where each was
composed and first performed, give the name of the composer and
many biographical details, and even discuss the formal and tonal
components of the music. Most intriguing of all, he appears to be
developing a new skill in middle life. Whereas before he could
merely talk about music, for the past two years he has been
learning to play it.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>Mr. Peek, who was dismissed as mentally retarded as a child and
later misdiagnosed as autistic, led a sheltered life, with few
people outside his family aware of his remarkable gifts. Then, in
1984, he met Mr. Morrow at a meeting of the Association of Retarded
Citizens in Arlington, Tex. Mr. Peek&acirc;&euro;&trade;s father
was chairman of the group&acirc;&euro;&trade;s communications
committee, and Mr. Morrow had helped create two television movies
about a retarded man named Bill (played by <a href=
"http://movies.nytimes.com/person/108826/Mickey-Rooney?inline=nyt-per"
title="">Mickey Rooney</a>).</p>
<p>After Mr. Peek displayed his memory skills in a conversation
with him, Mr. Morrow set about concocting a story around someone
like Kim Peek. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I was absolutely flabbergasted
that such a human being existed,&acirc;&euro; Mr. Morrow said in a
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2T45r5G3kA" title=
"&acirc;&euro;&oelig;The Real Rain Man&acirc;&euro;&oelig; documentary, via YouTube.">
2006 documentary about Mr. Peek</a>.</p>
<p>In &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Rain Man,&acirc;&euro; the autistic
character, Raymond Babbitt, has been institutionalized since he was
very young but is reunited with a cynical younger brother, Charlie
(played by <a href=
"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/tom_cruise/index.html?inline=nyt-per"
title="More articles about Tom Cruise.">Tom Cruise</a>), who had
forgotten about his brother&acirc;&euro;&trade;s existence. (The
title comes from Raymond&acirc;&euro;&trade;s recollection of the
infant Charlie&acirc;&euro;&trade;s name for him.) The two men take
a cross-country trip, and fraternal reconciliation ensues.</p>
<p>The movie, a critical and box office success, was not based on
Mr. Peek&acirc;&euro;&trade;s life, but in preparing for the role,
Mr. Hoffman visited with Mr. Peek and incorporated many of his
characteristics &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; a shambling gait, peculiar
hand movements and occasional blunt utterances &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
into the character of Raymond.</p>
<p>When Mr. Hoffman won an Oscar for best actor for the
performance, he thanked Mr. Peek in his acceptance speech. Mr.
Morrow went even further: he gave his own Oscar statuette to Mr.
Peek, who carried it with him to public appearances for the next 21
years.</p>
<p>In the wake of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Rain Man,&acirc;&euro; Mr.
Peek became something of a celebrity, emerging from his shell to
travel around the country giving demonstrations of his talent and
advocating tolerance for the disabled. Fran Peek estimated that
some 400,000 people have hugged Mr. Morrow&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
statuette.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;We called it the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
best-loved Oscar,&acirc;&euro; he said.</p>
<p>Laurence Kim Peek was born on Nov. 11, 1951. (He was named for
his mother&acirc;&euro;&trade;s favorite actor, <a href=
"http://movies.nytimes.com/person/1064439/Laurence-Olivier?inline=nyt-per"
title="">Laurence Olivier</a>, and the title character of <a href=
"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/rudyard_kipling/index.html?inline=nyt-per"
title="More articles about Rudyard Kipling.">Rudyard
Kipling</a>&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Kim&acirc;&euro;; Kipling was his
father&acirc;&euro;&trade;s favorite author.)
Kim&acirc;&euro;&trade;s head was enlarged, his cerebellum was
malformed and, perhaps most crucial, he was missing the corpus
callosum, the sheaf of nerve tissue that connects the
brain&acirc;&euro;&trade;s hemispheres. It has been theorized that
this disruption of normal communication between the
brain&acirc;&euro;&trade;s left and right halves resulted in a kind
of jury-rigged rewiring.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Perhaps the resulting structures allow the
two hemispheres to function, in certain respects, as one giant
hemisphere, putting normally separate functions under the same
roof, as it were,&acirc;&euro; Drs. Treffert and Christensen wrote.
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;If so, then Peek may owe some of his talents to
this particular abnormality.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>When Kim was 9 months old, a doctor said that he was so severely
retarded that he would never walk or talk and that he should be
institutionalized. When Kim was 6, another doctor recommended a
lobotomy. By then, however, Kim had read and memorized the first
eight volumes of a set of family encyclopedias, his father said. He
received part-time tutoring from the age of 7 and completed a high
school curriculum by 14. He spent great swaths of time absorbing
volumes in the Salt Lake City Public Library. He never used
computers, his father said.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;How he learned to read, I just
don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t know,&acirc;&euro; Mr. Peek said.</p>
<p>Kim Peek&acirc;&euro;&trade;s parents divorced in 1981, and his
father cared for him alone until his son&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
death. Besides his father, Mr. Peek is survived by his mother,
Jeanne Willey Peek Buchi; a brother, Brian; and a sister, Alison,
all of Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Rain Man&acirc;&euro; changed Mr.
Peek&acirc;&euro;&trade;s life. In the documentary, he confessed
that before the film, he never looked anyone in the face.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Barry influenced me more than any other
person,&acirc;&euro; he said of Mr. Morrow. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;He
made me &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Rain
Man.&acirc;&euro;&trade;&nbsp;&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>Though his social skills never fully developed, he grew to be
outwardly engaging. He enjoyed being among people in his travels
and became comfortable as something of a showman. He began
developing mental skills he had never had before, like making puns;
his coordination slowly improved, to the extent that he could play
the piano. He became more self-aware, even displaying a certain
social agility.</p>
<p>During a presentation Mr. Peek gave at <a href=
"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/o/oxford_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org"
title="More articles about Oxford University">Oxford University</a>
in England, after he fielded students&acirc;&euro;&trade; questions
about the Lusitania and about British monarchs, a young woman stood
and asked him, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Kim, are you
happy?&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m happy just to look at
you,&acirc;&euro; Mr. Peek said.</p>

  <p>
    <p>Sounds like a nice idea if you want document services with the
comfortable administration of MySQL.</p>

<div class="c5">

Friendly: Easy Schemaless &ldquo;NoSQL&rdquo; Data Storage with

<p><img src=

height="110" alt="friendly.png" class="c4" width="110"> <a href=
"http://friendlyorm.com/">Friendly</a> is a new Ruby ORM (a la
ActiveRecord) that lets you easily use NoSQL ideas on regular
database engines, such as MySQL. Developer James Golick has written
<a href=
"http://jamesgolick.com/2009/12/16/introducing-friendly-nosql-with-mysql-in-ruby.html">
a blog post introducing Friendly</a> that goes into detail on how
it works - with code examples. Effectively you get schema-less,
document-like storage (with indexes!) but based around MySQL.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with &#8221;<a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a>&#8221;, it&#8217;s a
blanket/branding term (somewhat like AJAX or Web 2.0) that covers
non-relational forms of databases that, typically, have no need for
SQL. A common subset of NoSQL technologies is the &#8220;document-based
database,&#8221; as provided by systems like <a href=
"http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> or <a href=
"http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> (for which RailsTips author
John Nunemaker <a href=
"http://railstips.org/2009/12/18/why-i-think-mongo-is-to-databases-what-rails-was-to-frameworks">
has evangelized strongly</a>).</p>
<p>An issue many people are having with the various NoSQL systems
available is that they&#8217;re not all &#8220;battle hardened&#8221; or as familiar
to administer than their existing MySQL or Postgres systems. Social
aggregator FriendFeed wrote about <a href=
"http://bret.appspot.com/entry/how-friendfeed-uses-mysql">how they
use MySQL to store schema-less data</a>, and Friendly is based on
the same techniques.</p>

<br class="c3">
<p>New web development frameworks, promising rapid development and
easy deployment, are sprouting out at a more rapid pace than you
can keep up. In the last article, we looked at the various factors
you&#226;&#8364;&#8482;d have to consider when deciding on a
framework. Today, we are going to look at the various frameworks
available for each facet of web development.</p>
<p>In this current day and age, pushing out a finished, polished
application well before your competitor is key. Coding everything
from scratch, excluding even the mundane things, can be extremely
time consuming and makes the developer spend time reinventing the
wheel, time which would rather be spent implementing new features
or tightening up the code base. This is where web development
frameworks come in.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to take a look at the various options you
have when choosing a web development framework. We are going to
cover every type of framework, right from server side frameworks
down to JavaScript animation frameworks. Intrigued?
Let&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s go take a look!</p>
<h3>Server Side Frameworks</h3>
<p>Server side frameworks are the one doing almost all the heavy
lifting behind the application. They handle almost every aspect of
the application right from URL handling to database access. You
have a variety of options for each platform. For the sake of
brevity, we&#226;&#8364;&#8482;ll look at only the most popular
ones today.</p>
<h3>CakePHP</h3>
<div><a href="http://cakephp.org/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/cakephp.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>CakePHP is a very popular PHP framework inspired by Ruby on
Rails and lets you develop, maintain and deploy applications with
ease.</p>
<p>This framework makes use of the MVC pattern and has a lot of
must have features including ORM, scaffolding and URL routing. The
built in libraries are pretty expansive and include helpers for
generating RSS feeds and HTML elements.</p>
<p>There is little to no configuration needed to get it up running
and has an excellent community and detailed documentation behind
it.</p>
<h3>CodeIgniter</h3>
<div><a href="http://codeigniter.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/ci.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>CodeIgniter is a PHP framework built on the tenets of
simplicity, speed and a small footprint and as such is among the
smallest PHP libraries in terms of the total footprint.</p>
<p>Among the frameworks which are built on the MVC pattern, CI is
the easiest to learn. If you are a beginner PHP programmer,
CodeIgniter would be the best place to start with.</p>
<p>Since it aspires to be as small as possible, the libraries
aren&#226;&#8364;&#8482;t as full fledged as Cake but the extremely
thorough documentation and the very friendly community more than
make up for it.</p>
<h3>Kohana</h3>
<div><a href="http://www.kohanaphp.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/kohana.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Kohana is a fork of CodeIgniter intended to work only with PHP
5. Kohana is completely community driven and every modification is
thoroughly discussed and vetted with in the community.</p>
<p>All the positive aspects of CI carry over here except that the
documentation can be relatively lacking. However it has a thriving
community behind it you can turn to if you run into errors.</p>
<h3>Zend</h3>
<div><a href="http://framework.zend.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/zend.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Zend framework is more of a glue framework in that things
aren&#226;&#8364;&#8482;t as tightly coupled as in other frameworks
like RoR or CakePHP. As such it also gives you a lot more
control.</p>
<p>This framework boasts of one of the most complete collection of
utility classes to leverage in your application. But since this is
a collection of classes than a proper framework,
you&#226;&#8364;&#8482;ll be looking at lots of configuration to
make it work. If you are thinking of starting off as a PHP
programmer, this isn&#226;&#8364;&#8482;t the first framework you
should try.</p>
<p>Having said that, it has excellent documentation and a very
large community behind it.</p>
<h3>Symfony</h3>
<div><a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/sym.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Symfony is yet another very popular, feature packed PHP
framework. It provides a solid core and ships with a number of
third party libraries to fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>This is marketed primarily as an enterprise framework and has
solid documentation and a thriving community to help you.</p>
<h3>ASP.NET</h3>
<div><a href="http://www.asp.net/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/asp.net.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>ASP.NET allows you to leverage the MVC pattern through ASP.NET
MVC. It lets developers use the accepted MVC pattern in their
applications. Or if you chose to, you can completely ignore MVC and
use the way you&#226;&#8364;&#8482;d normally want to.</p>
<p>It ships with a very impressive set of features including
libraries for code generation. It also has very thorough
documentation and a welcoming community behind it.</p>
<h3>Ruby on Rails</h3>
<div><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/ror.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Ruby on Rails is a framework for the Ruby platform and was
created by David Hansson whilst creating Basecamp for 37Signals.
Ruby on Rails has gained incredible growth ever since it was
released.</p>
<p>RoR uses the MVC pattern and provides a number of features
including a complete ORM, scaffolding and URL rewriting. Ruby, by
default, uses Prototype as it&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s JavaScript
library.</p>
<p>Ruby&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s incredible growth can be attributed to
ease of development and rich feature set. Configuration is
generally minimal to nothing. It has good documentation and a
growing community.</p>
<h3>Django</h3>
<div><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/django.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Django is a web development framework based on Python and is
amongst the most robust one on the Python platform.</p>
<p>Django ships with an extensive library containing tools for
caching, serialization, authentication. It even provides a simple
administrative interface based on your models and controllers. Its
URL rewriting mechanism is a little different in that it uses
regular expression to resolve which controller it needs to use.</p>
<p>It has extremely thorough documentation to back it up along with
a helpful, polite community. A beginner Python programmer will take
to Django very easily.</p>
<h3>Pylons</h3>
<div><a href="http://pylonshq.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/pylons.jpg"
alt="Tutorial Image"> border=&#8221;0&#8221; /&gt;</a></div>
<p>Similar to Zend, this is a very loosely coupled framework which
glues a number of third party libraries to provide
functionality.</p>
<p>In Pylons, each and every aspect can be switched out with the
one you like. Everything from it templating language to its ORM can
be switched out with minimal fuss.</p>
<p>With respect to features, it depends directly on the individual
components you pick for your project. Documentation can be
relatively lacking and the community is a little smaller too.</p>
<h3>TurboGears</h3>
<div><a href="http://turbogears.org/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/tg.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Similar to Kohana and CodeIgniter, Turbogears is built on top of
Pylons. It shares the same pros and cons as Pylons.</p>
<p>As with Pylons, every component of the framework can be replaced
with one of your own choosing. Currently it only uses Pylons for
its controller component.</p>
<h3>JavaScript Frameworks</h3>
<p>JavaScript frameworks work almost exclusively on the browser
side. A typical framework lets you navigate the DOM easier,
manipulate its contents right up to AJAX integration. There are a
couple of widget libraries too which let you use specific user
interface elements in your application instead of creating them
from scratch.</p>
<h3>jQuery</h3>
<div><a href="http://jquery.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/jquery.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>jQuery is an extremely popular library which focuses primarily
on DOM manipulation. It has an extensive API encompassing a range
of functionalities from DOM traversal to AJAX support.</p>
<p>It has very good documentation with a plethora of tutorials,
screencasts, references and books for you to go through. The
community is pretty large and very helpful.</p>
<p>If you are new to JavaScript and need to get started as quickly
as possible, jQuery is an excellent choice.</p>
<h3>Prototype</h3>
<div><a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/prototype.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Prototype is among the oldest JS libraries and as such is very
mature and stable. It ships with Ruby on Rails and as part of the
standard OS X installation.</p>
<p>It provides a clear API for all of the functionality it exposes
and has clear documentation to back it all up. Prototype also
provides various methods through which you can write clean class
based code. Prototype handles everything from DOM manipulation to
AJAX to providing a number of utility methods.</p>
<h3>MooTools</h3>
<div><a href="http://mootools.net/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/mootools.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Mootools presents itself as the ideal solution for the
intermediate to advanced programmer. It focuses on JavaScript as a
language and extends on it as much as possible.</p>
<p>It provides a robust class creation system just like Prototype
and just like the others, it provides a coherent API for all the
functionality it provides.</p>
<p>The documentation can be pretty lacking at times but the active
community more than makes up for it.</p>
<h3>Yahoo UI</h3>
<div><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/yui.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Yahoo UI library is a Swiss army kind of a library in that it
provides a complete set of features and widgets letting you build
the application you want to build. It is built by the developers at
Yahoo itself.</p>
<p>In YUI, the core library contains all the essential elements
including DOM traversal and CSS manipulation while the utilities
and widgets are optional and are available separately.</p>
<p>YUI has the most thorough documentation among JavaScript and is
easy to get started with.</p>
<h3>Dojo</h3>
<div><a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/dojo.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Dojo is yet another JS toolkit which provides everything that
you&#226;&#8364;&#8482;d expect from a modern JS library including
a selector engine, AJAX integration and so on.</p>
<p>It also provides a set of rich interface elements and a number
of advanced features like persistent connections and offline
storage. Dojo has very thorough documentation and a thriving
community.</p>
<h3>CSS Frameworks</h3>
<p>CSS frameworks, when properly used, let you cut down on
development time by cutting down on oft repeated declarations and
styling.</p>
<p>CSS frameworks can be a pretty polarizing topic among the
development community but you owe it to yourself to give it a
try.</p>
<h3>960Grid</h3>
<div><a href="http://960.gs/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/960.jpg"

<p>The 960 grid system intends to ease your workflow without
complicating things. There are 12 and 16 columns versions for added
choices.</p>
<p>It provides a CSS generator to further cut down on your
development time. It also has pre made templates for use in popular
software including Photoshop, Fireworks, Illustrator and Expression
Design.</p>
<h3>YAML</h3>
<div><a href="http://www.yaml.de/en/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/yaml.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>YAML, Yet Another Multi column Layout, is a CSS framework which
lets you create robust column based and/or grid based layout based
on web standards.</p>
<p>It also has a nifty tool for creating YAML CSS code. The
documentation is pretty thorough and the community, helpful.</p>
<h3>BluePrint</h3>
<div><a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/bp.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>

you spending mulling over grids and padding. It makes use of a
solid grid, support for typography and print support.</p>
<p>It features wiki based documentation and bug tracking. It boasts
an active community where you can post your queries.</p>
<h3>YUI Grids</h3>
<div><a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/" alt=
"Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/yuigrids.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Yet another Yahoo products on the list. YUI Grids offers support
for multiple widths, fluid layouts, flexible element placement and
more.</p>
<p>As with the YUI JS library, each part of this is thoroughly
documented with plenty of examples, sample code and screen
casts</p>
<h3>Elastic</h3>
<div><a href="http://elasticss.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/elastic.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Elastic is a very simple framework with support for fixed,
liquid and elastic layouts.</p>
<p>Elastic has a growing community and pretty decent
documentation.</p>
<h3>JS Animation Frameworks</h3>
<p>Recently, specialized JS animation libraries have been popping
up with the sole purpose of providing easier way to animate user
interfaces. Let&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s a look at the most popular
ones.</p>
<h3>Scripty 2 and script.aculo.us</h3>
<div><a href="http://scripty2.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/s2.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Scripty and script.aculo.us are based on Prototype and provide a
way to seamlessly animate content as well as provide a number of
user interface elements to use in our applications.</p>
<h3>fx</h3>
<div><a href="http://fx.inetcat.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/fx.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>fx is a standalone JS library which focuses exclusively on
animation. As such it lets you animate each and every CSS property
along a set time line.</p>
<p>It has decent documentation and is extremely small at less than
4 kb.</p>
<h3>gx</h3>
<div><a href="http://gx.riccardodegni.net/docs" alt=
"Link"><img src="http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/gx.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>gx is a cross browser framework which again focuses exclusively
on animation. It has a number of extremely impressive features
including easing, delayed animation and predefined animation
rules.</p>
<p>Since it is relatively new, the documentation is a little
lacking and the community is hard to find. But it is extremely
impressive and definitely warrants a try.</p>
<h3>Processing.JS</h3>
<div><a href="http://processingjs.org/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/processing.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Processing.js is built on the canvas element and written by John
Resig. It lets you draw elements and then manipulate them on the
canvas element.</p>
<p>Since it is a port of Processing for the JS language, it shares
most of its advantages including robust support animation
capability and shape support.</p>
<h3>jsAnim</h3>
<div><a href="http://www.jsanim.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/jsanim.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>jsAnim is yet another animation library which lets you create
very impressive animations. The example on the front page itself is
a wonderful example of what can be done with it.</p>
<p>It weights in at a hefty 25 kilobytes compared to 3.7 for fx but
packs a lot of features. The documentation is pretty straight
forward and should give you a good idea of the basics.</p>
<h3>Raphael</h3>
<div><a href="http://raphaeljs.com/" alt="Link"><img src=
"http://nettuts.s3.cdn.plus.org/521_webFrameworks/images/rjs.jpg"
border="0" alt="Tutorial Image"></a></div>
<p>Raphael is a tiny library which lets you work with vector
elements on your web page. It uses SVG or VML as needed to generate
its graphics.</p>
<p>It&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s extremely robust and produces extremely
impressive results. A look through the demo pages gives you an idea
of what it is capable of.</p>
<p>The documentation is pretty thorough and the discussion group is
pretty active too.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>And we are done! We looked at all the choices you have when you
need to choose a web development framework. We looked at all types
of frameworks right from humongous server side frameworks to nimble
JS animation frameworks. Hopefully, this has been useful to you and
you found it interesting.</p>

  <p>
    <p>I really need to get on this band wagon.</p>

OpenID Ends 2009 With 1 Billion Users</a></div>
<div class="c2">via <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/" class=
"f">ReadWriteWeb</a> by Jolie O&#8217;Dell on 12/16/09</div>
<br class="c3">
<p><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/openID-logo.png">At the
close of a whiz-bang year, OpenID has a lot to be proud of.</p>
<p>With a community of 9 million sites that use OpenID logins and 1
billion individual users, OpenID has effectively revolutionized the
way we are able to create and maintain portable identities. Best of
all, it&#8217;s not just bloggers and geeks who sang OpenID&#8217;s praises:
The U.S. federal <a href=
"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/openid_going_mainstream_us_gov_announces_pilot_pro.php">
government got on board</a> this year, too.</p>
<p class="c4"><em>Sponsor</em><br>
<a href=
"http://d.ads.readwriteweb.com/ck.php?n=a6d5ead9&amp;cb=17472"><img src="http://d.ads.readwriteweb.com/avw.php?zoneid=14&amp;cb=17472&amp;n=a6d5ead9"
border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>OpenID accounts are enabled by such providers as AOL, Blogger,
Flickr, Google, LiveJournal, MySpace, Verisign, WordPress and Yahoo
with announcements of upcoming OpenIDs from Microsoft and PayPal.
Sites that allow users to login with OpenID range from major
retailers and music labels to news organizations and social
sites.</p>
<p>As for the government, at the Gov 2.0 Summit in Washington, DC,
earlier this year, the General Services Administration and several
government agencies announced they would adopt OpenID as part of
the White House&#8217;s Open Government Initiative. Participating
companies included Yahoo!, PayPal, Google, Equifax, AOL, VeriSign,
Acxiom, Citi, Privo and Wave Systems. On the government side is the
Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of
Health (NIH), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),
and related agencies.</p>
<p>Not only is the government&#8217;s involvement a vote of confidence
for OpenID&#8217;s innovation; it also speaks to the product&#8217;s security
progress, which was spearheaded by security committee head and
PayPal exec Andrew Nash.</p>
<p>In addition to developing and spreading the OpenID product,
there&#8217;s also the OpenID Foundation, which appointed its first
executive committee, including Chris Messina and Don Thibeau, in
2009.</p>
<p>Portable identity is one of our favorite themes from this year,
and we applaud what OpenID has been able to accomplish. What do you
look forward to seeing from the product, the foundation and OpenID
partner sites in the year to come? Let us know your thoughts in the
comments.</p>

    <p>Looks like there is an automatic mode available.<br>
But I&#8217;m guessing it doesn&#8217;t work well if the network isn&#8217;t
found.<br>
I don&#8217;t know enough about WebDav to have a good option about it
without doing the full setup for myself.<br>

on the pages of Gizmodo</a>, but this former Disney employee&#8217;s
efforts are definitely the best use of the game that I&#8217;ve ever
seen.</p>
<p>Using 21,268 lights and LEDs, ex-Disney imagineer and special
effects specialist Ric Turner turned the front of his house into
the perfect setting for a <a href=

"Click here to read more posts tagged #guitarherochristmaslights">Guitar
Hero Christmas lights</a> spectacular.</p>
<p>As he explains:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>Christmas Light Hero is using 7 light controllers from
Light-O-Rama built from kits to control 21,268 lights and LEDs.
Each controller has 16 outputs and 2-3 TTL level control inputs
that are used by the game system to fire different programmed light
sequences depending on what happens in the game. It relies on the
fact that the game sequence is very consistent. If the game and the
lighting sequences start together, they will stay in very good sync
through the length of the song. The light program allows branching
and overlays for fail, star power and &#8220;ready.&#8221; I have some ideas to
automate the initial show/game sync, but for now you have to push
doorbell buttons at the right moments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rubberneckers watching in their cars can tune into the frequency
99.1 to hear the audio, or even partake in the fun if they dare.

stunned and amazed us earlier this year with his incredible
paintings of classic video games for your

<p>We realize desktop wallpaper isn&#8217;t necessarily the most
productive thing on the planet, but you spend countless hours at
your computer every week, and sometimes a fresh wallpaper is just
the ticket for some rejuvenation.</p>

regular updates on new images that he&#8217;s working on, as well as news
about an upcoming video game using his artwork. I don&#8217;t know about
you, but the idea of a video game based on his artwork sounds
really great.</p>

<p>Granted, this platform looks cool and everything, but it seems
like you would have to have a perfectly spherical room to take full

<p>Tricked by YouTube again. This video series really teaches
something instead of just saying how easy it is to learn. I like
how this instructor needs to reference the sheet music later in the
series. He is human after all.</p>


<p>Hopefully one day I&#8217;ll be good enough to actually apply these
principles and it would make a real difference to my technique.
Until then it&#8217;s back to reading sheet music for me.</p>

width="500">Firefox and Safari partially support it, Google&#8217;s Wave
and Chrome projects are banking on it, and most web developers are
ecstatic about what it means. It&#8217;s HTML5, and if you&#8217;re not exactly
sure what it is, here&#8217;s an explainer.</p>
<p><em>Image taken from <a href=
"http://www.slideshare.net/carsonified/the-future-of-html-5-by-bruce-lawson">
Bruce Lawson&#8217;s fantastic HTML5 presentation</a>.</em></p>
<h3 class="c4">What is HTML5? Some kind of really fancy link
tag?</h3>
<p><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html">HTML5</a>
is a specification for how the web&#8217;s core language, HTML, should be
formatted and utilized to deliver text, images, multimedia, web
apps, search forms, and anything else you see in your browser. In
some ways, it&#8217;s mostly a core set of standards that only web
developers really need to know. In other ways, it&#8217;s a major
revision to how the web is put together. Not every web site will
use it, but those that do will have better support across modern
desktop and mobile browsers (that is, everything except Internet
Explorer).</p>
<h3 class="c4">What Awesomeness can I expect from HTML5?</h3>
<p><img src=
"http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/12/new_html5_tags.jpg"
width="340">The big, marquee changes in HTML5 have already made
some headlines, thanks to browser makers like Google, Apple,
Mozilla, and others picking them up and implementing them. The
shortlist:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offline storage:</strong> Kind of like &#8220;Super Cookies,&#8221;
but with much more space to store both one-time data and persistent
app databases, like email. Actually, you can think of offline
storage as something a lot like Google Gears&#226;&#8364;&#8221;you
just won&#8217;t need to install a plug-in to reap the benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Canvas drawing:</strong> Sites can mark off a space on
a page where interactive pictures, charts and graphs, game
components, and whatever else imagination allows can be drawn
directly by programming code and user
interaction&#226;&#8364;&#8221;no Flash or other plug-ins
required.</li>
<li><strong>Native video and audio streaming support:</strong> It&#8217;s
in the very early stages and subject to format disruption, but
sites like YouTube and Pandora could one day skip Flash entirely to
bring you streaming audio and video, with timed playback and other
neat features.</li>
<li><strong>Geolocation:</strong> Just what it sounds like, but not
limited to a single provider&#8217;s API or browser tool. HTML5 can find
your location and use it to tailor things like search results, tag
your Twitter updates, and more. Location-aware devices <a href=
"http://lifehacker.com/395171/how-your-location+aware-iphone-will-change-your-life">
are a big deal</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Smarter forms:</strong> Search boxes, text inputs, and
other you-type-here fields get better controls for focusing,
validating data, interacting with other page elements, sending
through email, and more. It may not sound that sexy, but it could
mean less annoyance as a user, and that&#8217;s always a good thing.</li>
<li><strong>Web application focus:</strong> Without breaking down
the hundreds of nuts and bolts, it&#8217;s fair to say that HTML5 is
aimed at making it easier to build wikis, drag-and-drop tools,
discussion boards, real-time chat, search front-ends, and other
modern web elements into any site, and have them work the same
across browsers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="c4">Where can I see HTML5 in action?</h3>
<p>Ooh, good question!</p>
<p>From this page right here, with a
soon-to-be-optional-maybe-Flash, you can check out these video
demonstrations:</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re running an up-to-date version of Firefox, Safari,
Chrome, or Opera&#226;&#8364;&#8221;or, basically, any regularly
updated browser besides Internet Explorer&#226;&#8364;&#8221;give
these links a shot.</p>

width="500"><br>
Neat interactive site that shows tweets from folks who are digging
on HTML5, with streaming background audio and interactive data
pieces.</p>
<h3 class="c4">Why is it being pushed? Don&#8217;t Flash and JavaScript
already work?</h3>
<p>Make no mistake, HTML5 has much love for JavaScript and its many
relatives&#226;&#8364;&#8221;in fact, the new markup standards make
it easier for JavaScript-type code to point at, and pull from,
pieces of each web page. As for Flash, and Silverlight, and other
browser plug-ins, well, they are artificial solutions for a natural
problem that HTML5 is trying to fix: Placing and managing
interactive elements on a web page.</p>
<p><img src=
"http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/12/flash_install.jpg"
width="340">Besides being a major source of browser memory leaks
and crashes, Flash and its brethren also doesn&#8217;t work on every
platform, and has to be re-written and adapted for every new one.
If you&#8217;re looking to make a clever application available to as many
people as possible, a <a href=
"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/one_mobile_app_for_multiple_platforms_a_reality.php">
write once, use everywhere system</a> is ideal. When more browsers
and developers support HTML5&#8217;s audio, video, and interaction
standards, the idea of the web as the universal app
store&#226;&#8364;&#8221;for smartphones, for desktops and laptops,
Windows, Mac, and Linux&#226;&#8364;&#8221;gets closer to
reality.</p>
<p>Apple tried to pitch this mentality to developers with their
first iPhone release. That pronouncement was, to put it mildly,
<a href=
"http://daringfireball.net/2007/06/wwdc_2007_keynote">roundly
mocked</a>. Since then, webapps have become a lot more powerful and
respectable as mainstays of productivity, and enthusiasm for the
walled garden model of application markets has waned quite a bit in
the minds of an increasing number of developers.</p>
<p><img src=
"http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/12/wave_iphone.jpg"
width="340">That&#8217;s not to say that HTML5-powered web applications,
with their lack of serious local storage, hardware access, and
serious offline capabilities, are going to make the iPhone App
Store, the Android Market, or the desktop software we&#8217;re all used
to obsolete. But look at how Chrome is <a href=
"http://lifehacker.com/5408594/first-glimpse-at-google-chrome-os">positioning
its Chrome OS for netbooks</a>, which relies on HTML5 for offline
storage: A <em>secondary</em> computer, in terms of hard-and-fast
capabilities, but one you might use just as often, if not more, for
the web-connected convenience.</p>
<h3 class="c4">How will HTML5 makes its way onto my web?</h3>
<p>HTML5 isn&#8217;t a software release, or a web development law. It&#8217;s a
voted-upon and group-edited standard, written in broad fashion to
accommodate different styles of development and the different
thinking among web browser makers.</p>
<p>Put more simply, it depends on what you&#8217;re using to surf. And
what standards your web makers are following.</p>
<p><img src=
"http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/12/browser_compare.jpg"
width="340">Firefox, Safari, and Chrome on the desktop support a
few of the styles and features outlined in HTML5&#8217;s draft
specifications, like offline storage, canvas drawing, and, most
intriguingly, tags for audio and video that allow sites to stream
multimedia files directly into a browser. Apple&#8217;s Safari for iPhone
and the Android browser also support elements of HTML5, as does
Opera Mobile. Want to know the nitty-gritty of where your browser
stands on HTML5? Web geeks have put in the time to <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_layout_engines_%28HTML5%29">
put it all in a Wikipedia chart</a>.</p>
<p>Those audio and video tags aren&#8217;t quite as liberating as they
may seem. The writers of the HTML5 standard&#226;&#8364;&#8221;Ian
Hickson of Google and Davd Hyatt of Apple&#226;&#8364;&#8221;wanted
to define a single, standardized format for video streaming, but
while their employers favor the <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC">H.264/MPEG-4</a>
standard, open-source firms like Mozilla can&#8217;t abide by its patent
&#8220;encumbrance,&#8221; and Opera and other web firms don&#8217;t particularly
love the licensing costs. Their alternative is <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theora">Theora</a>, better known
(relatively) as Ogg Theora. As it stands, HTML5 simply doesn&#8217;t
require or suggest a single container format or codec to use, which
could mean browser-by-browser differences down the road. Ars
Technica has a <a href=
"http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/07/decoding-the-html-5-video-codec-debate.ars">
good explainer on the HTML5 video codec debate</a>.</p>

Flavors: 10 Code-Free Minutes to a Sexier Web Presence</a></div>

do-it-yourself website space is so crowded right now that it&#8217;s
amazing to see anyone launch a product and cut through the noise.
Still, we were captivated by the simplicity and design of <a href=
"http://flavors.me">Flavors.me</a>. Similar to <a href=
"http://card.ly">Card.ly</a>, instead of forcing you to use
Facebook, LinkedIn or your neglected blog to represent you, Flavors
lets you to build a basic vanity site in less than 10 minutes. As
of this evening non-designers will have a chance to revel in their
newly found web sex appeal.</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/7105366">Flavors.me</a> from <a href=
"http://vimeo.com/jackzerby">Jack Zerby</a> on <a href=
"http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>ReadWriteWeb spoke to co-founder Jonathan Marcus to get an early
look at the service. The basic premise is that Flavors lets you
produce a well-designed springboard to portfolio pieces, current
work and profiles. Users add links, edit fonts and colors, and
upload a background photo. Rather than fiddling with cascading
style sheets or modifying blog templates, this service offers a
fast and easy way to create an elegant web presence.</p>
<p>Under the banner of <a href=
"http://www.linkedin.com/companies/hii-def-inc.">Hii Def Inc.</a>
internet incubator, brothers Jonathan and David Marcus and former
<a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a> design lead Jack Zerby created
Flavors as just one of three companies to launch in 2009. Prior to
Flavors.me, the group produced online sneaker shop <a href=
"http://superkix.com/">Superkix</a>. As a hybrid of both Flavors
and Superkix, the team will soon release an online storefront tool
by the name of <a href="http://goodsie.com/">Goodsie</a>.</p>
<p>Says Jonathan Marcus, &#8221; We wanted to sell Superkix t-shirts
online but weren&#8217;t satisfied with Yahoo Stores, Shopify or
BigCartel and realized there were enough re-usable elements from
Flavors to make it feasible to build in parallel.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Superkix is an obvious revenue generator as a retail
storefront, the group plans on offering a domain redirect feature
to Flavors in mid-December as well as a yearly subscription fee
after a 30-day trial. Upon launch, Goodsie will be available with a
monthly subscription.</p>
<p>Says Marcus, &#8220;Both [services] will dramatically reduce the cost
and complexity associated with maintaining a web presence. Any
other monetization model such as advertising would introduce
competing and distracting interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Users can test Flavors later this evening at <a href=
"http://flavors.me">flavors.me</a>. In the meantime, you may want

  <p>
    <p>Google, it&#8217;s about time you released this. Goodbye baby blues.
Hello choice.</p>

Google Sites Offers Templates; Claims It&#8217;s Easier Than
Sharepoint</a></div>

height="109" alt="sites_infographic.jpg" width="150"><a href=
"http://sites.google.com">Google Sites</a> is getting an upgrade.
Starting today, Google will provide templates that it claims makes
it possible for users with no technical background to create web
sites with a degree of functionality that includes page layouts,
adding links for navigation and embedded gadgets.</p>
<p>Templates are available for intranets, project sites, team
sites, employee profile pages and other sites that people would use
within the enterprise. Employees using Google Sites may submit
their own templates to a gallery, similar to the services that
Sharepoint offers.</p>

height="420" alt="adknnsqz3k_364grb78dcv_b.png" width="600"></p>
<p>Google Sites is making a clear strike against Microsoft which
requires a certain level of technical skill to create a <a href=
"http://sharepoint2010.microsoft.com/Pages/default.aspx">Sharepoint
site</a>.</p>
<p>The differences between Google and Microsoft are often quite
striking. Microsoft is a document-centric organization. Sharepoint
uses a file system architecture for customers to deposit their
documents. With Sharepoint, companies may use a web inetrface to
share their documents.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s approach is entirely web centric. Documents are web
pages. Each document is a link, not a file. When documents are
uploaded to Google, they are converted, so to speak, each document
receiving its own unique URL.</p>
<p>It is this approach that you see with Google Sites. By being
entirely web-centric, Google believes it is making it easier for
employees to share information, act faster and cross-pollinate
ideas.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to say which approach is better though web
converts will tell you that sharing web links is far easier than
files. We agree with that point but the Sharepoint environment is
tremendously popular. It has its core set of users who are happy
that they can share documents in such a manner. Most organizations
work in a document centric environment and are therefore
comfortable with Sharepoint. It&#8217;s an environment that many people
trust.</p>

<p>Today, Twitter moved into a new, much larger office in San
Francisco. The space, which was previously
Bebo&acirc;&euro;&trade;s SF office, is right around the corner
from their old one.</p>
<p>A few members of the Twitter team spent much of the weekend
decorating the new digs with a number of Twitter-themed elements
like birds and @ symbols. Check out some of the pictures being
posted to the web by Twitter employees below. And yes, there is a
DJ booth &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and <a href=

<br class="c3">
<p><img src=

width="500">Time and time again, people tell me that they&#8217;ve bought
an external hard drive to back up their pictures, music, and
documents. Great, right? Sadly, that&#8217;s not always the case.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one simple rule about backups that everybody needs to
fully understand: <strong>Your files should exist in at least Two
places, or it&#8217;s no longer a backup&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and your data
is at risk.</strong> Too often people delete the files from their
primary PC, assuming they are backed up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to educate people on proper backup strategy, so we&#8217;ll
run through your options and talk about the pros and cons. These
days, you&#8217;ve got plenty of choices on the <a href=
"http://lifehacker.com/398229/five-best-windows-backup-tools">Windows
side of things</a>, Mac users have Time Machine, and there&#8217;s
<a href=
"http://lifehacker.com/5405041/five-best-online-backup-tools">online
backup for anybody</a>.</p>
<h3>Backing Up to a Local Source</h3>
<p><img src=
"http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/11/sshot-2009-11-16-11-05-53.jpg"
width="340">When it comes to local backup applications, it&#8217;s really
a matter of preference, since most of them do the job adequately
without a lot of fuss. The <a href=
"http://lifehacker.com/5144757/first-look-at-windows-7s-backup-and-restore-center">
Backup and Restore application built into Windows 7 or Vista</a> is
a perfectly acceptable choice, and will handle most backups with
ease. My personal choice is a paid version of <a href=
"http://www.2brightsparks.com/syncback/syncback-hub.html">SyncBack
SE</a>, but there&#8217;s <a href=
"http://lifehacker.com/398229/five-best-windows-backup-tools">plenty
of other choices</a> for Windows, and all of them do the job.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember when backing up your data
is that you can&#8217;t delete it from your main system once it&#8217;s been
backed up to an external drive. By doing that, you&#8217;ve left yourself
with only a single copy of your important files, on an external
drive that has just as much chance of dying as your internal PC
hard drive. Think it can&#8217;t happen to you? One of my external drives
died last week.</p>
<h3>Backing Up to an Online Source</h3>
<p><img src=
"http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/17/2009/11/thumb160x_sshot-2009-11-16-11-11-58.jpg"
width="158">There&#8217;s <a href=
"http://lifehacker.com/5405041/five-best-online-backup-tools">quite
a few online backup services to choose from</a>, and while the
great thing about online backup is that you don&#8217;t have to deal with
external drives, you&#8217;re leaving your data in somebody else&#8217;s hands,
and restoring all of your files can take an extremely long time,
since you&#8217;ll have to download all of the files again. If you don&#8217;t
have a ton of personal files, online backup is a great choice, if
you don&#8217;t mind putting your faith in somebody else to keep your
data secure.</p>
<h3>Backing Up a Total System Image</h3>
<p><img src=
"http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/11/sshot-2009-11-16-11-40-39.jpg"
width="340">Without question, the easiest form of backup to restore
from is a complete image of your system. We&#8217;ve already covered a
list of the <a href=
"http://lifehacker.com/5303067/five-best-free-system-restore-tools">
best free system restore tools</a>, and Gina walked through how to
<a href=
"http://lifehacker.com/326086/hot-image-your-pcs-hard-drive-with-driveimage-xml">
hot image your PC hard drive with DriveImage XML</a>, but if you
really want an easy experience you might want to check out one of
the paid tools like <a href=
"http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/trueimage/">Acronis
True Image</a>.</p>
<p>These tools are the best way to recover from a total system
failure, but they usually aren&#8217;t quite as easy to restore a single
file from, which is a much more likely scenario. There&#8217;s been
dozens of times that I&#8217;ve needed to restore an older version of a
document, and was able to easily grab the previous version from
Dropbox or my external drive.</p>
<h3>What Should You Back Up?</h3>
<p><img src=
"http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/11/sshot-2009-11-16-11-29-20.jpg"
width="340">When you&#8217;re backing up your files, there&#8217;s no reason to
make a backup of every single thing on your hard drive-in fact, it
would be a huge waste of space to back up your Windows folder if
you have to reinstall the whole system in order to restore the
backups again. Here&#8217;s a couple of pointers to help you choose what
you really need to back up, and what you don&#8217;t:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your entire Users folder:</strong> either at
C:\Users\Username for Windows 7 or Vista, or C:\Documents and
Settings\ for Windows XP. This folder should contain all of your
documents, settings, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Your Data Folders:</strong> If you&#8217;ve created other
data on your hard drives, you should include those as well.</li>
</ul>
<br>
What you don&#8217;t need to back up?
<ul>
<li><strong>Your Program Files Folder:</strong> There&#8217;s simply no
reason to back up your installed applications when they all have to
be re-installed if you had to restore your machine. It&#8217;s a waste of
space to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Your Windows Folder:</strong> The only real good reason
to back up your Windows folder is just in case you can&#8217;t find the
same drivers again. On the other hand, there are <a href=
"http://lifehacker.com/5102344/driverbackup2-copies-your-system-drivers">
any number</a> <a href=
"http://lifehacker.com/399097/double-driver-backs-up-your-systems-drivers">
of tools</a> to <a href=
"http://lifehacker.com/224599/download-of-the-day-driver-collector-windows">
back up your drivers</a>, and you should do that once in a while
instead of backing up the entire Windows folder.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Backup Strategy: Combo</h3>
<p>Your best bet is to combine a number of different methods into
your backup strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create a System Image:</strong> Use one of the many
system restore tools to create a complete image of your PC, which
will protect you in case of a catastrophic system failure. You&#8217;ll
want to back this up to your external drive.</li>
<li><strong>Use a Backup Tool:</strong> Just pick one, any one, and
start using it. Back up your data to an external drive, another PC,
or anywhere else. Just make sure you don&#8217;t delete the data from the
primary PC.</li>
<li><strong>Use an Online Backup for Important Files:</strong> Even
though you are backing up to an external drive, you might want to
start using something like Dropbox or Mozy to back up your most
important files.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Just remember, all of your files need to be in at least Two places
at once. You don&#8217;t want to get <a href=
"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/03/journalspace-drama-all-data-lost-without-backup-company-deadpooled/">
Journalspaced</a>.

<p>When chopping large diameter logs into more manageable and
fireplace-friendly sizes, it can be a pain to keep all the pieces
upright as you split them. Check out the video below to see how an
the simple addition of a bungee cord means you&#8217;ll spend more time
chopping and less time setting up logs to be split.</p>

watched it twice already. I keep searching for clues that it&#8217;s just

<p>Despite all the <a href=

watching Oli jumping around. I know that he&#8217;s a talented man and
that this clip is almost certainly not edited in ways that enhance

    <p>Finally, some one else (and a more reputable one), shares my
Rails plug in pain. Lets make Ruby fun again, and less
magical.<br></p>

<br class="c3">
<p>Carl and I have been working on the plugins system over the past
few days. As part of that process, we read through the <a href=
"http://guides.rubyonrails.org/plugins.html">Rails Plugin
Guide</a>. While reading through the guide, we noticed a number of
idioms presented in the guide that are serious overkill for the
task at hand.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame the author of the guide; the idioms
presented are roughly the same that have been used since the early
days of Rails. However, looking at them brought back memories of my
early days using Rails, when the code made me feel as though Ruby
was full of magic incantations and ceremony to accomplish
relatively simple things.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<div class="CodeRay code">
<pre>
module Yaffle def self.included(base) base.send :extend, ClassMethods end &Acirc;  module ClassMethods # any method placed here will apply to classes, like Hickwall def acts_as_something send :include, InstanceMethods end end &Acirc;  module InstanceMethods # any method placed here will apply to instaces, like @hickwall end end
</pre></div>
<p>To begin with, the <code>send</code> is completely unneeded. The
<code>acts_as_something</code> method will be run on the Class
itself, giving the method access to <code>include</code>, a private
method.</p>
<p>This code intended to be used as follows:</p>
<div class="CodeRay code">
<pre>
class ActiveRecord::Base include Yaffle end &Acirc;  class Article &lt; ActiveRecord::Base acts_as_yaffle end
</pre></div>
<p>What the code does is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Register a hook so that when the module is included, the
ClassMethods are extended onto the class</li>
<li>In that module, define a method that includes the
InstanceMethods</li>
<li>So that you can say <code>acts_as_something</code> in your
code</li>
</ol>
<p>The crazy thing about all of this is that it&rsquo;s completely
reinventing the module system that Ruby already has. This would be
exactly identical:</p>
<div class="CodeRay code">
<pre>
module Yaffle # any method placed here will apply to classes, like Hickwall def acts_as_something send :include, InstanceMethods end &Acirc;  module InstanceMethods # any method placed here will apply to instances, like @hickwall end end
</pre></div>
<p>To be used via:</p>
<div class="CodeRay code">
<pre>
class ActiveRecord::Base extend Yaffle end &Acirc;  class Article &lt; ActiveRecord::Base acts_as_yaffle end
</pre></div>
<p>In a nutshell, there&rsquo;s no point in overriding
<code>include</code> to behave like <code>extend</code> when Ruby
provides both!</p>
<p>To take this a bit further, you could do:</p>
<div class="CodeRay code">
<pre>
module Yaffle # any method placed here will apply to instances, like @hickwall,  # because that's how modules work! end
</pre></div>
<p>To be used via:</p>
<div class="CodeRay code">
<pre>
class Article &lt; ActiveRecord::Base include Yaffle end
</pre></div>
<p>In effect, the initial code (override included hook to extend a
method on, which then includes a module) is two layers of
abstraction around a simple Ruby include!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a few more examples:</p>
<div class="CodeRay code">
<pre>
module Yaffle def self.included(base) base.send :extend, ClassMethods end &Acirc;  module ClassMethods def acts_as_yaffle(options = {}) cattr_accessor :yaffle_text_field self.yaffle_text_field = (options[:yaffle_text_field] || :last_squawk).to_s end end end &Acirc;  ActiveRecord::Base.send :include, Yaffle
</pre></div>
<p>Again, we have the idiom of overriding <code>include</code> to
behave like <code>extend</code> (instead of just using
<code>extend</code>!).</p>
<p>A better solution:</p>
<div class="CodeRay code">
<pre>
module Yaffle def acts_as_yaffle(options = {}) cattr_accessor :yaffle_text_field self.yaffle_text_field = options[:yaffle_text_field].to_s || "last_squawk" end end &Acirc;  ActiveRecord::Base.extend Yaffle
</pre></div>
<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s appropriate to use an
<code>acts_as_yaffle</code>, since you&rsquo;re providing
additional options which could not be encapsulated using the normal
Ruby <code>extend</code>.</p>
<p>Another &ldquo;more advanced&rdquo; case:</p>
<div class="CodeRay code">
<pre>
module Yaffle def self.included(base) base.send :extend, ClassMethods end &Acirc;  module ClassMethods def acts_as_yaffle(options = {}) cattr_accessor :yaffle_text_field self.yaffle_text_field = (options[:yaffle_text_field] || :last_squawk).to_s send :include, InstanceMethods end end &Acirc;  module InstanceMethods def squawk(string) write_attribute(self.class.yaffle_text_field, string.to_squawk) end end end &Acirc;  ActiveRecord::Base.send :include, Yaffle
</pre></div>
<p>Again, we have the idiom of overriding include to pretend to be
an extend, and a <code>send</code> where it is not needed.
Identical functionality:</p>
<div class="CodeRay code">
<pre>
module Yaffle def acts_as_yaffle(options = {}) cattr_accessor :yaffle_text_field self.yaffle_text_field = (options[:yaffle_text_field] || :last_squawk).to_s include InstanceMethods end &Acirc;  module InstanceMethods def squawk(string) write_attribute(self.class.yaffle_text_field, string.to_squawk) end end end &Acirc;  ActiveRecord::Base.extend Yaffle
</pre></div>
<p>Of course, it is also possible to do:</p>
<div class="CodeRay code">
<pre>
module Yaffle def squawk(string) write_attribute(self.class.yaffle_text_field, string.to_squawk) end end &Acirc;  class ActiveRecord::Base def self.acts_as_yaffle(options = {}) cattr_accessor :yaffle_text_field self.yaffle_text_field = (options[:yaffle_text_field] || :last_squawk).to_s include Yaffle end end
</pre></div>
<p>Since the module is <strong>always</strong> included in
<code>ActiveRecord::Base</code>, there is no reason that the
earlier code, with its additional modules and use of extend, is
superior to simply reopening the class and adding the
<code>acts_as_yaffle</code> method directly. Now we can put the
<code>squawk</code> method directly inside the <code>Yaffle</code>
module, where it can be included cleanly.</p>
<p>It may not seem like a huge deal, but it significantly reduces
the amount of <strong>apparent</strong> magic in the plugin
pattern, making it more accessible for new users. Additionally, it
exposes the new user to <code>include</code> and
<code>extend</code> quickly, instead of making them feel as though
they were magic incantations requiring the use of <code>send</code>
and special modules named <code>ClassMethods</code> in order to get
them to work.</p>
<p>To be clear, I&rsquo;m not saying that these idioms aren&rsquo;t
sometimes needed in special, advanced cases. However, I am saying
that in the most common cases, they&rsquo;re huge overkill that
obscures the real functionality and confuses users.</p>

<br class="c3">
<p><img src=
"http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/gogopher.png">Big
news for developers out there: Google has just announced the
release of a new, open sourced programming language called
<i>Go</i>. The company says that Go is experimental, and that it
combines the performance and security benefits associated with
using a compiled language like C++ with the speed of a dynamic
language like Python. Go&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s official mascot is
Gordon the gopher, seen here.</p>
<p>Here&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s how Google describes Go in its blog
post:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>Go attempts to combine the development speed of working in a
dynamic language like Python with the performance and safety of a
compiled language like C or C++. In our experiments with Go to
date, typical builds feel instantaneous; even large binaries
compile in just a few seconds. And the compiled code runs close to
the speed of C. Go is designed to let you move fast.</p>
<p>We&#226;&#8364;&#8482;re hoping Go turns out to be a great
language for systems programming with support for multi-processing
and a fresh and lightweight take on object-oriented design, with
some cool features like true closures and reflection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For more details check out <a href=
"http://golang.org/">Golang.org</a>.</p>
<p>To get things started the right way, here&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s
Go&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s rendition of Hello World!:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>05 package main</p>
<p>07 import fmt &#226;&#8364;&#339;fmt&#226;&#8364; // Package
implementing formatted I/O.</p>
<p>09 func main() {<br>
10 fmt.Printf(&#226;&#8364;Hello, world; or
&#206;&#353;&#206;&#177;&#206;&#187;&#206;&#183;&#206;&#188;&#206;&#173;&#207;&#206;&#177;
&#206;&#186;&#207;&#338;&#207;&#402;&#206;&#188;&#206;&#181;; or
&#227;&#8220;&#227;&#8218;&#8220;&#227;&#171;&#227;&#161;&#227;&#175;
&#228;&#184;&#8211;&#231;&#8226;&#338;n&#226;&#8364;);<br>

Classical Music Workshops Warm the White House</a></div>

<br class="c3">
<p>Last Wednesday, the White House welcomed 120 middle and high
school music students from all over the country to participate in
four different engaging workshops. &Acirc;&nbsp;From the Blue Room
to the Map Room and the East Room to the Diplomatic Reception Room,
beautiful music and instructors&#8217; guiding voices echoed through the
halls of this historic home.&Acirc;&nbsp; Aspiring students plucked
their bows and strummed the strings of their guitars, while picking
up tips and queues from their instructors, renowned classical
musicians Awadagin Pratt on the piano, Joshua Bell on violin,
Sharon Isbin with classical guitar, and Alisa Weilerstein on
cello.</p>

<p>In her session, Ms. Weilerstein posed a question to her
students. &#8220;How do we get someone excited about classical music?&#8221;
she asked. &Acirc;&nbsp;Bright young minds quickly offered up a
number of ideas. &#8220;Use classical instruments to play modern pieces,&#8221;
said one young lady. &#8220;Play Classical music for people who&#8217;ve never
heard it,&#8221; said another. As the students listened to each
other&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ideas, they also talked about the
opportunities they had to discover magic through music; they
discussed the importance of keeping music education in schools and
communities, where all children would have an opportunity to
discover these great art forms just like they did.</p>
<p>As the workshops concluded, everyone gathered in the historic
East Room for a concert put on by their four
instructors.&Acirc;&nbsp; First Lady Michelle Obama made a special
visit, and told the students that through music, &#8220;You&#8217;ll learn that
if you believe in yourself and put in your best effort, that
there&#8217;s nothing you can&#8217;t achieve; and those aren&#8217;t just lessons
about music, these are really lessons about life.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a privilege to welcome so many young musicians living
such talented and full lives on a beautiful fall day at the
people&#8217;s house.&Acirc;&nbsp; The White House is honored to share
these experiences with all students. Check out all the video:</p>

Murdoch</a> says he&#8217;ll bar Google from indexing any of his
sites.</p>
<p>Apparently Murdoch is under the impression that readers who come
into his vast media empire (which includes <i>Sun</i>, <i>The
Times</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, FOX News/movies/channel,
MySpace, and I-don&#8217;t-even-remember-what-else) through Google aren&#8217;t
going to lead to any sort of profit:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p>If they&#8217;re just search people&#8230; They don&#8217;t suddenly become
loyal readers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As those &#8220;search people&#8221; are worthless, they can be ignored and
blocked in Murdoch&#8217;s world. He explains that there the only way to
actually make any money on the Internet today is to charge for all
content and force users to access it directly, because otherwise
&#8220;no news websites or blog websites anywhere in the world making
serious money.&#8221;</p>
<p>On one hand, good luck with cutting off one of the most used
paths to any online content and then expecting a check, Rupe. On
the other, if Twitter can charge Bing and Google for indexing
rights, shouldn&#8217;t one of the world&#8217;s most powerful content creators
be able to? [<a href=

"http://www.improveverywhere.com">Improv Everywhere</a> just posted
their latest &#8220;mission,&#8221; a musical about the joys of lunch sung
inside the atrium of Trump Tower. But this time, they got to record
it using a boatload of NBC&#8217;s high-tech gear.</p>
<p>Because the Today Show was doing a piece on pranks and wanted
Ann Curry to be involved, they got involved and pulled out all the
stops. They set up a huge tech control room in a storage area, with
seven guys working seven joysticks connected to seven robotic HD
cameras. The cameras were hidden throughout the atrium behind
tinted glass and in plants.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s gotta be hard to go back to using cameras hidden in duffel
bags after this.</p>

without the toolbar. Maybe via Firefox extension. I guess that

12 Interesting Upcoming Ruby and Rails Events (That Aren&rsquo;t

<div class="c2">via <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com" class=

<br class="c3">
<p>Wanted to go to <a href="http://jrubyconf.com/">JRubyConf</a> or
<a href="http://www.rubyconf.org/">RubyConf</a> this year? Tough -
they&#8217;re sold out already. Luckily, though, there are some
interesting upcoming events that you <i>can</i> still get in to -
some online, some in multiple cities, some held in youth centers,
some in hotels, and even one on a tropical island. Whew!</p>
<h3>Free &#8220;Optimizing Your Online Store&#8221; Webinar (Online; September
24, 2009)</h3>
<p><img src=

height="30" alt="newrelic.png" class="c4" width="144"></p>
<p>New Relic is running <a href="http://www.newrelic.com/webinar">a
free webinar event</a> on Thursday, September 24 for developers and
customers interested in optimizing e-commerce sites ready for the
2009 holiday season. The webinar will feature New Relic customer
<i>SheetMusicPlus.com</i> and will provide tips for getting your
online store prepared.</p>
<p>Naturally, being a New Relic event, the focus will be on New
Relic&#8217;s RPM product and a special webinar-only discount will be
offered. Given the quality of New Relic&#8217;s other materials though, I
doubt it&#8217;s going to be a sales pitch from start to finish. <a href=

in a draw to win an iPod nano.)</i></p>
<h3>RubyFoo (London, UK; October 2-3, 2009)</h3>
<p class="c5"><img src=

height="37" alt="rubyfoo.png" class="c4" width="139"></p>
<p><b><a href="http://jaoo.dk/ruby-london-2009/">RubyFoo</a></b> is
a Ruby conference taking place in London in October, 2009. It&#8217;s
being put on by Trifork, the company behind the successful JAOO
developer conferences. RubyFoo is a sort of follow up to the
RubyFools conference they put on in Copenhagen, Denmark last year.
Speakers include Sam Aaron, Ola Bini (JRuby), Adam Wiggins, Aslak
Hellesoy, and Matz, and the general theme of the conference is
&#8220;communicative programming.&#8221; <b>Note: You can use the promotion
code of &#8221;<i>Rubyinside</i>&#8221; to get &Acirc;&pound;50 off
registration.</b></p>
<h3>Rails Roadshow (USA; October and November, 2009)</h3>
<p><img src=
"http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/railsroadshow.png"
height="76" alt="railsroadshow.png" class="c4" width="114">The
<a href="http://www.railsroadshow.com/"><b>Rails Roadshow</b></a>
is a series of five free events being organized by esteemed Rails
hosting company <i>Engine Yard</i>. In order:</p>
<ul>
<li>October 26 - <i>Boston, MA</i></li>
<li>October 27 - <i>Chicago, IL</i></li>
<li>October 29 - <i>Austin, TX</i></li>
<li>October 30 - <i>Los Angeles, CA</i></li>
<li>November 2 - <i>Seattle, WA</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite being an Engine Yard-heavy event, the schedule is quite
varied with speakers from Amazon, New Relic, and CVSDude in
addition to those from Engine Yard. The theme is &#8220;performance in
the cloud.&#8221; For free, it seems like a nice morning out (the event
finishes at midday) and you get breakfast - what&#8217;s not to like?</p>
<h3>Aloha On Rails (Hawaii; October 4-6, 2009)</h3>
<p><b><img src=
"http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/aloha.png"
height="51" alt="aloha.png" class="c4" width="116"></b><b><a href=
"http://www.alohaonrails.com/">Aloha on Rails</a></b> is a brave
new entry to the Rails conference circuit, taking place in Hawaii
in early October. If you&#8217;ve always wanted to try and get a Hawaii
vacation on the company dime, this is the time to build up your
powers of persuasion. The conference bills itself as &#8220;the premier
destination event for Ruby on Rails and Web development&#8221; and
promises three unique days (2 for conference, 1 for tutorials) of
Ruby and Rails related fun.<br>
The speaker list for Aloha is pretty significant. Names include
Chad Fowler, Obie Fernandez, Gregg Pollack, Desi McAdam, Charles
Nutter, Yehuda Katz, Sarah Mei, Tammer Saleh, Chad Pytel, Blake
Mizerany, Pat Maddox, and Ezra Zygmuntowicz.. and that&#8217;s only the
start of it - <a href="http://www.alohaonrails.com/speakers/">see
all of them</a>.</p>

<h3>Rails Summit Latin America 2009 (S&Atilde;&pound;o Paulo,
Brazil; October 13-14, 2009)</h3>
<p><a href=
"http://railssummit.locaweb.com.br/en/pages/home"><b>Rails Summit
Latin America</b></a> comes back for a second run in 2009 - taking
place between October 13-14 in sunny S&Atilde;&pound;o Paulo,
Brazil. Last year&#8217;s event attracted 550 attendees, so for a
regional Ruby/Rails conference it did amazingly. This year it costs
400 Brazilian Real to attend (about $200).</p>
<p>Speakers lined up to speak so far include Bryan Liles, Carlos
Brando, Chad Fowler, Gregg Pollack, Ilya Grigorik, Jason Seifer,
Matt Aimonetti, Obie Fernandez, Pratik Naik, Rich Kilmer, and
several prominent South American Rubyists. It&#8217;s a bit of an
all-star affair!</p>
<p><img src=
"http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/railscamp.png"
height="62" alt="railscamp.png" class="c4" width="85"></p>
<h3>Rails Camps (Margate, UK and Melbourne, Australia; October /
November 2009)</h3>
<p><a href="http://railscamps.com/"><b>Rails Camps</b></a> is a
series of Rails related get-togethers, run in a lo-fi style in,
usually, Australia and the United Kingdom. Two Rails Camps are on
the calendar for late 2009. The <a href=
"http://railscamps.com/#uk_october_2009">first</a> in Margate, UK
(an interesting seaside resort, to say the least) on October 16-19
and the <a href=
"http://railscamps.com/#au_november_2009">second</a> in Melbourne,
Australia on November 20-23. Previous reports show that these
events seem to go down really well, especially if you want to get
away from it all for a few days and hang out with fellow geeks - so
check it out.</p>
<h3>RubyEnRails (Amsterdam, Netherlands; October 30-31, 2009)</h3>
<p><img src=
"http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/rer2009.png"
height="62" alt="rer2009.png" class="c4" width="128"></p>
<p>Where Euruko is Europe&#8217;s equivalent of RubyConf, <a href=
"http://2009.rubyenrails.nl/?locale=en">RubyEnRails</a> is starting
to look like Europe&#8217;s answer to RailsConf. This year, RubyEnRails
takes place in Amsterdam on October 30 and 31 and speakers include
Jeremy Kemper, Yehuda Katz, Jonathan Weiss, Eloy Duran, Bart ten
Brinke, Willen van Bergen, and Edwin Vlieg. It only costs 79 euro
(about $120 or &Acirc;&pound;70) and it sounds like it&#8217;s been a fun
event in previous years.</p>
<p class="c6">Note: I always seem to miss some awesome events in
these roundups so, as always, please leave comments recommending
your own events, those I&#8217;ve forgotten, etc.</p>
